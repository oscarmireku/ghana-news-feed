      "content": "<p>The John Mahama administration remains on course to roll out its flagship 24-hour economy policy but requires patience as legal and institutional frameworks are put in place.</p><p>This is according to Matthew Kojo Njourkone, a director of interparty and CSO relations of the governing National Democratic Congress (NDC), as he pushes back against claims that little has been achieved one year into office.</p><p>Speaking on The Forum on Asaase Radio Matthew Kojo Njourkone said the policy could not be implemented immediately, arguing that major structural reforms take time.</p><p>“The 24-hour economy cannot be done overnight. Some of the structures must first have a legal framework before that project can take off,” Njourkone said. “The government is on course to ensure the needed structures are laid, so it is a matter of patience.”</p><p>He said while progress varied across sectors, it was inaccurate to suggest the government had delivered nothing.</p><p>Meanwhile, the government plans to have its 24-hour economy program fully operational by the end of 2026, the Minister of Youth Development and Empowerment, George Opare-Addo, said on Thursday.</p><p>Speaking in an interview with Kumasi-based Nhyira FM, Opare-Addo emphasised that the policy aims to transform the traditional eight-hour workday system into a continuous 24-hour economic structure, a process he said requires time and legislative support.</p><p>“Changing the entire structure of an economy that has been in place for years, from an 8-hour to a 24-hour system, cannot happen in less than 12 months. It requires legislative measures and directives, and those processes are underway,” he said.</p><p>The minister encouraged Ghanaians to anticipate the full integration of the policy later this year.</p><p>“Everyone who is honest will see that progress is being made. Changing the structure of the economy is not a one-time event; it is a process that takes time to unfold. We are clearly on track, and by the end of this year, we expect to see the full impact of the 24-hour economy,” Opare-Addo added.</p><p>Asaase Broadcasting Company airs on Asaase 99.5 Accra, Asaase 98.5 Kumasi, Asaase 99.7 Tamale, Asaase 100.3 Cape Coast, AsaasePa 107.3 (Accra).\nAffiliates: Bawku FM 101.5, Bead FM 99.9 (Bimbilla), Mining City Radio 89.5 (Tarkwa), Nandom FM 101.9, Nyatefe Radio 94.5 (Dzodze), Sissala Radio 96.3 (Tumu), Somuaa FM 89.9 (Gushegu), Stone City 90.7 (Ho) and Wale FM 106.9 (Walewale).\nListen online: asaaseradio.com, Sound Garden and TuneIn.\nFollow us:\nX: @asaaseradio995, @Asaase985ksi, @Asaase997tamale, @asaase1003, asaasepa1073\nInstagram: asaaseradio99.5, asaase985ksi, asaase100.3, asaase99.7tamale, asaasepa107.3\nLinkedIn: company/asaaseradio995. TikTok: @asaaseradio99.5\nFacebook: asaase99.5, asaase985ksi, Asaase100.3, asaase99.7, AsaasePa107.3.\nYouTube: AsaaseRadioXtra.\nJoin the conversation.

      "content": "<p>In the heart of Ghana, amid the hum of schoolyards and the gentle rustle of Sunday morning hymnals, a quiet but powerful revolution is unfolding. It isn’t political. It isn’t driven by trends or TikTok algorithms. It’s spiritual. It’s melodic. And it’s coming from a voice far younger than most would expect.</p><p>Her name is Emily Adade Boateng. She is 13 years old. And she is steadily reshaping the sound and spirit of contemporary gospel music, one divinely inspired song at a time.</p><p>While many of her peers are navigating homework schedules and early adolescence, Emily is writing, recording, and releasing music that carries theological depth, emotional maturity, and spiritual authority well beyond her years. Her voice doesn’t sound borrowed or rehearsed — it sounds convicted. Close your eyes while she sings and you might imagine a seasoned worship leader with decades of ministry behind them, not a teenager balancing school and studio sessions.</p><p>Yet Emily is very real, and very present.</p><p>Emily’s musical journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. After releasing her debut album King of Glory at just 11 years old, she quickly established herself as more than a novelty act. The project, rich with worship anthems like “Mighty Rock,” “Halleluyah,” and “Ride in Victory” featuring KDM, announced the arrival of a young minister with a clear spiritual assignment.</p><p>Her second album, Miracle Working God, released in June 2025, further solidified her place in gospel music. With nine tracks of confident, worship-driven songwriting, the project showcased growth, consistency, and creative fearlessness.</p><p>Then came December 2025, when Emily released the single “GLORY”,  a reverent, praise-filled offering that reaffirmed her focus on worship over trends.</p><p>Read Also: Gospel Duo Willie and Mike Donate to Kumasi Children’s Home</p><p>Just weeks later, on January 3, 2026, Emily reached yet another milestone with the release of her third studio album, NYAME PREKOPE (meaning “God Alone”). The 10-track album brings her total number of released songs to 36 — an astonishing catalogue for an artist still in her early teens.</p><p>Emily’s impact is no longer confined to church pews and family playlists. At the just-ended WMA awards, she emerged as one of the night’s most talked-about winners, taking home two major honours:</p><p>Best Gospel Song of the Year</p><p>Best New Artist of the Year</p><p>The wins are a powerful affirmation, not just of her talent, but of the resonance her music is having across generations. In a category often dominated by long-established voices, Emily’s recognition signals a shift: gospel music is listening to its youngest ministers.</p><p>What makes Emily Adade Boateng stand out isn’t only her age or productivity,  it’s her intentionality.</p><p>Her catalogue spans praise, worship, thanksgiving, repentance, and national reflection. From peace-themed anthems to deeply personal worship songs, her writing carries clarity of message and sincerity of faith. Collaborations with respected gospel figures such as Selina Boateng, Joyce Blessing, and KDM have further validated her place in the space — not as a child being accommodated, but as a voice being respected.</p><p>Emily does not chase relevance. She pursues purpose. And in doing so, she has quietly built a growing audience within and beyond Ghana.</p><p>It is tempting to label Emily as “the future of gospel music.” But that description no longer fits.</p><p>She is not waiting for her time. She is already ministering in it.</p><p>Her songs are being sung in homes, played on radio, shared in churches, and embraced by listeners who connect not to her age, but to her message. With humility, discipline, and a clear sense of calling, Emily Adade Boateng is proving that spiritual impact is not measured by years lived, but by purpose embraced.</p><p>In her school uniform, with lyrics in her notebook and worship in her heart, Emily stands as a reminder of a timeless truth: when God calls, He equips — regardless of age.</p><p>Adam Ro Music Ltd Announces International Media Travel Program</p>"

It was nothing to boast about before, but presently there has been a lot of achievement in that direction,” Njourkone said.</p><p>“Everybody knows that food prices have gone down. A bag of maize that used to sell around 1,500 cedis is now going for about 500 cedis, and even at that price you struggle to get buyers,” he said.</p><p>Njourkone also pointed to gains in healthcare, education and environmental protection, citing the government’s “no fee stress” policy in education and a tree-planting initiative aimed at restoring degraded land. He said these interventions showed a broader governance approach beyond currency performance.</p><p>Responding to criticism over delays in implementing the government’s flagship 24-hour economy policy, Njourkone said the programme required legal and institutional frameworks that could not be established overnight.</p><p>“Some of the structures must first have a legal basis. The government is on course, and it is a matter of patience,” he said.</p><p>He rejected claims that the administration had failed to tackle illegal mining, known locally as galamsey, arguing that much of the environmental damage was inherited. He said laws that previously allowed mining in restricted areas had been reversed and that expectations of immediate results were unrealistic.</p><p>Njourkone also said the government had reduced the size of government and cut back on non-essential spending, including restrictions on non-official travel, measures he said were helping to stabilise the economy.</p><p>“Changes cannot be done overnight, but it should not be said that nothing is being achieved,” he said, adding that improvements in some sectors would gradually extend to others.</p><p>Asaase Broadcasting Company airs on Asaase 99.5 Accra, Asaase 98.5 Kumasi, Asaase 99.7 Tamale, Asaase 100.3 Cape Coast, AsaasePa 107.3 (Accra).\nAffiliates: Bawku FM 101.5, Bead FM 99.9 (Bimbilla), Mining City Radio 89.5 (Tarkwa), Nandom FM 101.9, Nyatefe Radio 94.5 (Dzodze), Sissala Radio 96.3 (Tumu), Somuaa FM 89.9 (Gushegu), Stone City 90.7 (Ho) and Wale FM 106.9 (Walewale).\nListen online: asaaseradio.com, Sound Garden and TuneIn.\nFollow us:\nX: @asaaseradio995, @Asaase985ksi, @Asaase997tamale, @asaase1003, asaasepa1073\nInstagram: asaaseradio99.5, asaase985ksi, asaase100.3, asaase99.7tamale, asaasepa107.3\nLinkedIn: company/asaaseradio995. TikTok: @asaaseradio99.5\nFacebook: asaase99.5, asaase985ksi, Asaase100.3, asaase99.7, AsaasePa107.3.\nYouTube: AsaaseRadioXtra.\nJoin the conversation.

The Union also alleged victimisation and intimidation of workers who speak out against management practices.</p><p>The Divisional Union said it had previously submitted similar petitions to the Office of the President and the National Media Commission, and expressed confidence in President Mahama’s commitment to accountability, transparency, and the protection of public institutions.</p><p>Copies of the latest petition were also sent to the Chief of Staff at Jubilee House, the Secretary-General of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and the General Secretary of the PSWU.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) has questioned claims of economic progress under President John Dramani Mahama, arguing that improvements in the exchange rate have not eased rising living costs or delivered promised jobs one year into his administration.</p><p>Speaking on Asaase Radio’s The Forum, on Saturday (10 January) Ross Osei Owusu, a member of the NPP’s legal team, said basic commodities, building materials and utility tariffs have all increased over the past year, undermining government assertions of economic recovery.</p><p>Owusu cited a series of electricity and water tariff increases approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) in 2025, including hikes of 14.75% for electricity and 4.02% for water in May, followed by further electricity increases in July and October, and sharp adjustments of 9.86% for electricity and 15.92% for water announced ahead of Christmas.</p><p>“If you pick our basic commodities on the market, all of them have virtually seen increments in the last year,” Owusu said. “If cement prices are rising and utilities are going up, then what has the better exchange rate really done for the economy?”</p><p>He said the cumulative impact of the increases far outweighed gains from recent single-digit adjustments to base pay.</p><p>“This is a big slap to the ordinary Ghanaian,” he said. “How much was increased in base pay, about nine percent, and look at what people have been asked to absorb.”</p><p>Owusu also criticised the government’s handling of its flagship 24-hour economy policy, which he said had not been implemented as promised during the election campaign.</p><p>“In Nana Akufo-Addo’s time, Free SHS was implemented almost immediately,” he said. “The second coming of John Mahama’s flagship programme was the 24-hour economy. Can anyone honestly say it has been duly implemented?”</p><p>He argued that limited extended working hours at institutions such as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) and the ports did not amount to the three-shift system promised and warned that the policy’s core objective of job creation was being undermined.</p><p>“There is something the 24-hour economy is supposed to be associated with, and that is jobs,” Owusu said. “You cannot tell us DVLA is doing 24 hours while people are being sacked.”</p><p>President Mahama’s government has defended its record, pointing to currency stability and ongoing consultations on the 24-hour economy as evidence that reforms are on track, but debate over whether economic gains are translating into real relief for households continues to intensify.</p><p>For Presidential Aide, Rosemond Obeng, the administration of President John Dramani Mahama had reversed economic decline marked by rising living costs and widespread hardship.</p><p>“Looking at the cruel haircut, cost of living, there was even a point in time that Ghana Statistical Service came out with an analysis that about 8.5 million people in the country, which is about a quarter of our country, sleep on an empty stomach every day,” Obeng said.</p><p>Asaase Broadcasting Company airs on Asaase 99.5 Accra, Asaase 98.5 Kumasi, Asaase 99.7 Tamale, Asaase 100.3 Cape Coast, AsaasePa 107.3 (Accra).\nAffiliates: Bawku FM 101.5, Bead FM 99.9 (Bimbilla), Mining City Radio 89.5 (Tarkwa), Nandom FM 101.9, Nyatefe Radio 94.5 (Dzodze), Sissala Radio 96.3 (Tumu), Somuaa FM 89.9 (Gushegu), Stone City 90.7 (Ho) and Wale FM 106.9 (Walewale).\nListen online: asaaseradio.com, Sound Garden and TuneIn.\nFollow us:\nX: @asaaseradio995, @Asaase985ksi, @Asaase997tamale, @asaase1003, asaasepa1073\nInstagram: asaaseradio99.5, asaase985ksi, asaase100.3, asaase99.7tamale, asaasepa107.3\nLinkedIn: company/asaaseradio995. TikTok: @asaaseradio99.5\nFacebook: asaase99.5, asaase985ksi, Asaase100.3, asaase99.7, AsaasePa107.3.\nYouTube: AsaaseRadioXtra.\nJoin the conversation.

      "content": "<p>QNET, the wellness and lifestyle focused direct selling company, hosted a New Year Media Soirée in Accra, bringing together members of the press and key stakeholders to mark a fresh start for 2026, reflect on milestones from the past year, and outline the company’s priorities for the months ahead.</p><p>Speaking at the event, Bola Ray, Spokesperson and Country Business Agent for QNET in Ghana, highlighted two standout achievements from 2025: QNET’s first major regional African convention in Ghana, and the formal collaboration with EOCO to address the misuse of QNET’s name by fraudulent actors.</p><p>In February 2025, QNET hosted its first major African regional convention in Accra, drawing nearly 5,000 participants from across the region to learn about the company’s business model and wellness and lifestyle products. Building on this momentum, QNET announced plans for an even larger V-Africa event in 2026, expected around mid-year in Accra.</p><p>“Tonight is about a new beginning for QNET in Ghana,” said Bola Ray. “We are excited to build on the momentum of what we achieved last year and to bring even more visibility to the real QNET—our entrepreneurship story, our products, and our contribution to communities.”</p><p>Bola Ray also shared that QNET is working to establish a QNET Experience Centre in Ghana, which will be open to the public soon, allowing visitors to experience QNET products firsthand and get accurate information directly.</p><p>Strengthening compliance and community awareness with EOCO</p><p>Following Bola Ray, Naana Quartay, Head of Compliance for QNET, spoke about QNET’s ongoing collaboration with the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) and the company’s compliance-driven approach to public engagement.</p><p>Naana Quartay noted that beyond the partnership framework, QNET and EOCO jointly conducted multiple roadshows across cities in Ghana to engage communities at the grassroots level—particularly communities often targeted by job scams and illegal migration schemes carried out under the false guise of “QNET opportunities.”</p><p>She added that intelligence sharing and coordination have contributed to impactful outcomes, including the reported rescue of over 300 victims and support for the repatriation of foreign nationals who were deceptively brought into Ghana under false promises linked to QNET.</p><p>“In 2026, we look forward to expanding our roadshows and rolling out broader public awareness campaigns with EOCO,” said Naana Quartay. “Education and prevention—done consistently and at the community level—remain among the strongest tools we have.”</p><p>Compliance Office launched in July 2025 to support enforcement collaboration</p><p>As part of its strengthened compliance infrastructure, QNET highlighted the launch of its Compliance Office in July 2025, established as a central point of coordination for law enforcement and security agencies to collaborate with QNET in addressing fraudulent activities linked to misuse of the brand name. QNET also noted that the Director-General of CIDLydia Donkor officiated the opening of the Compliance Office, reflecting institutional support and a shared commitment to safeguarding the public.</p><p>Product momentum in 2025 and new launches planned for 2026</p><p>QNET also shared that 2025 saw continued growth and interest in its wellness and lifestyle portfolio, including products such as EDGE Plus, the Amezcua wellness range, and HomePureair and water purifiers.</p><p>Looking ahead, QNET said 2026 will include the launch of a new range of wearable wellness products, along with new supplements designed to support immunity, energy, and sleep.</p><p>Community initiatives: financial literacy and inclusive education support</p><p>Reaffirming its ongoing contributions to Ghana, QNET highlighted its free financial literacy programme, launched in late 2024, designed for vulnerable communities to support better money management and informed decision-making. The programme has reached more than 1,000 beneficiaries across five cities.</p><p>QNET also spotlighted the work of its CSR arm, the RYTHM Foundation, which has supported Ghana’s ANOPA Project for the past four years, helping schools in Cape Coast and Accrathat specialise in education for children with disabilities and special needs. QNET noted that these efforts have received awards recognising their impact.</p><p>More partnerships and events expected in 2026</p><p>QNET shared that it is exploring opportunities to bring additional international partners to Ghana for events in 2026, with further announcements to be made as plans are finalised. The company also expressed appreciation for its growing partnership with Bola Ray, noting his role in supporting public understanding and engagement.</p>"

      "content": "<p class=\"ql-align-center\">The morning of Wednesday, 7 January 2026 saw me smiling as I listened to the 6am news during my walk. The date was interesting and significant for me for two reasons. Firstly, the presenter reminded us, listeners that, it was Constitution Day,as Ghana’s Fourth Republican Constitution became operational thirty-three years earlier on 7 January 1993.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>The smile&nbsp;was&nbsp;occasioned&nbsp;partly&nbsp;by the reminder that,&nbsp;I was a member of the Consultative Assembly,&nbsp;which drafted the Constitution in&nbsp;1991-1992.&nbsp;Secondly, for Ghana’s&nbsp;“Millennium-Parade” of Friday, 7 January 2000,&nbsp;twenty-six years earlier&nbsp;at the Black-Star Square, the Parade-Commander was Colonel Dan&nbsp;Frimpong, Commanding Officer, Ghana Military Academy, as I was then.&nbsp;The combined effect of these two facts of history&nbsp;dawning on me&nbsp;loosened&nbsp;my facial muscles&nbsp;into that broad smile!</p><p><br></p><p>Before I continue, I have&nbsp;a correction. In my article last&nbsp;week&nbsp;titled, “Names of Houses in Secondary Schools,” I stated that&nbsp;Achimota&nbsp;School was established by the Anglican Church. I have been corrected by my&nbsp;friend/colleague writer Kofi&nbsp;Otutu&nbsp;Adu&nbsp;Labi&nbsp;Esq&nbsp;that,&nbsp;the State established Achimota, and not the Anglican Church. However, the first headmaster was an Anglican priest. I&nbsp;apologise&nbsp;for the mistake.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Consultative Assembly</strong></p><p><br></p><p>On 31 July 1991,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Committee&nbsp;of nine&nbsp;Experts,&nbsp;established under PNDC Law 252 (1991)&nbsp;headed by&nbsp;Nana&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;Kwadwo&nbsp;Boaten&nbsp;(SKB)&nbsp;Asante,&nbsp;presented a 252-page&nbsp;draft report/proposal&nbsp;to the PNDC&nbsp;government to&nbsp;transition it&nbsp;from a military dictatorship to a&nbsp;civilian&nbsp;democratic rule, following&nbsp;intense&nbsp;international pressure, as well as local pressure from the Movement for Freedom and Justice (MFJ)&nbsp;etc.</p><p><br></p><p>This report formed the basis of the work of the 258-member&nbsp;Consultative Assembly, leading to the Fourth Republican Constitution in&nbsp;April&nbsp;1992.&nbsp;Originally&nbsp;meant to have 260 members, the Ghana Bar Association and the National Union of Ghana Students refused to&nbsp;send representatives following&nbsp;disagreements.</p><p><br></p><p>I was one of the eight representatives of the Ghana Armed Forces&nbsp;comprising four officers and four men&nbsp;in the 258-member Consultative Assembly.</p><p><br></p><p>The nine-member Committee-of-Experts&nbsp;comprised&nbsp;of the following:</p><p>1.&nbsp;Nana&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;SKB Asante&nbsp;–&nbsp;Chairman, lawyer, academic&nbsp;and&nbsp;Paramount&nbsp;Chief of&nbsp;Asokore-Ashanti. Members were:</p><p>2.&nbsp;Osagyefo&nbsp;Oseadeeyo&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Agyemang&nbsp;Badu,&nbsp;Omanhene&nbsp;of&nbsp;Dorma</p><p>3.&nbsp;Mrs&nbsp;Justice Annie&nbsp;Jiagge&nbsp;–Retired Appeal Court Judge</p><p>4.&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;LJ&nbsp;Chinery-Hesse, a Legal draughtsman</p><p>5.&nbsp;Ebo&nbsp;Bentsi-Enchill, a lawyer</p><p>6.&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Afari-Gyan, Lecturer Department&nbsp;of Political&nbsp;Science, University of Ghana</p><p>7.&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Charles&nbsp;Jebuni,&nbsp;Lecturer&nbsp;in Economics, University of&nbsp;Ghana.</p><p>8.&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;EVO&nbsp;Danquah, Law Lecturer, University of&nbsp;Ghana</p><p>9.&nbsp;Mrs&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ofori&nbsp;Boateng,&nbsp;Director Legal&nbsp;Drafting, Office of the Attorney-General and&nbsp;Member Secretary.</p><p><br></p><p>The draft document by the&nbsp;“SKB Asante&nbsp;Committee-of-Experts”&nbsp;proposed two options for consideration by the Consultative Assembly. They were&nbsp;what&nbsp;became known&nbsp;as&nbsp;the&nbsp;“winner-takes-all system,”&nbsp;and the Proportional Representation.&nbsp;For some reason,&nbsp;which many&nbsp;attributed to government directive,&nbsp;the Proportional Representation option&nbsp;was not considered&nbsp;at all&nbsp;for discussion.</p><p><br></p><p>The Speaker of the Consultative Assembly was&nbsp;Pe&nbsp;Rowland&nbsp;Ayagitam&nbsp;II, the&nbsp;Chiana&nbsp;Pio.&nbsp;Justice Robert&nbsp;Hayfrom&nbsp;-Benjamin served&nbsp;as&nbsp;our&nbsp;first Deputy Speaker while&nbsp;Mrs&nbsp;Joyce Bamford-Addo&nbsp;was our Second Deputy Speaker.</p><p><br></p><p>Working&nbsp;between 1991-1992,&nbsp;the Consultative Assembly&nbsp;submitted its draft Constitution to the PNDC on 30 March 1992.&nbsp;Rather controversially, an indemnity clause&nbsp;for PNDC members,&nbsp;which was not discussed, was inserted into the Constitution at the&nbsp;eleventh hour&nbsp;of the last day of our sitting. A referendum on&nbsp;28 April&nbsp;1992&nbsp;approved the draft Constitution with 92%. The 1992 Constitution came into Force on 7 January 1993.</p><p><br></p><p>Ghana’s 1992&nbsp;Constitution which is still operational&nbsp;is currently under review by the Professor H&nbsp;Kwasi&nbsp;Prempeh&nbsp;Constitutional Review Commission (CRC).&nbsp;Earlier, the Professor&nbsp;Fiadjoe&nbsp;Constitution Review Commission set up by in January 2010 by President&nbsp;Attah-Mills submitted its report in December 2011.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Millennium-Parade”</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The second cause of&nbsp;my broad smile on the morning of&nbsp;7th&nbsp;January 2026 was my&nbsp;recollection of the “Millennium-Parade”&nbsp;I commanded on 7th&nbsp;January 2000.Worldwide anticipation of the entry into a new millennium 2000 from&nbsp;31stDecember 1999 was fraught&nbsp;eeriely&nbsp;with&nbsp;fear,&nbsp;anxiety/speculation, from the scientific to the supernatural to the superstitious.</p><p><br></p><p>Command of the Millennium Parade&nbsp;was not exempt&nbsp;from these fears.&nbsp;But,&nbsp;for me as the Commanding Officer of the Ghana Military Academy&nbsp;(CO GMA)&nbsp;busy training cadets, I considered myself “safe” as there was no precedence of a CO GMA commanding a national parade.&nbsp;So, when I read the&nbsp;letter on 4 December 1999 appointing&nbsp;me the Parade Commander,&nbsp;I sighed&nbsp;asking, “O God, who did this to me&nbsp;and why?”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Majestic</strong></p><p><br></p><p>For many years, Majestic majestically dominated&nbsp;Black Star Square parades as Ghana’s foremost parade-horse. The choice of the name Majestic was apt as the mighty stallion was majestic in all respects. He was handsome, intelligent, strong and regal, commanding instant respect and admiration.</p><p><br></p><p>Introducing him&nbsp;to me as my parade-horse when I was tasked in early December 1999 to command the Millennium-Parade a month away, my riding instructor then&nbsp;Sgt&nbsp;(now ex-WO1)&nbsp;Suka, a tough soldier/rider told me,&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir, Majestic is a very proud horse. You either ride him, or he rides you!”</p><p><br></p><p>He recounted instances Majestic had messed up parade commanders in earlier years, with dire consequences to their careers.&nbsp;With this advice/warning, I gave my instructor a blank-cheque&nbsp;to do anything to me to ensure a successful parade!&nbsp;Soon, the strenuous killer horsemanship training he subjected me to, made me regret my decision.&nbsp;But&nbsp;he toughened me as I lost five-kilograms in a month.</p><p><br></p><p>Majestic and I soon developed mutual respect for each other, and became friends. Having discovered that Majestic had a&nbsp;sweet-tooth, I started my day with him at 6am after my physical training from 5am, by giving him sugar which he happily licked from my palm. Thereafter my instructor and I would ride to our&nbsp;training grounds between Burma Camp,&nbsp;Teshie&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Kpeshie-Lagoon. Today, the whole area now called “Tse-Addo” is&nbsp;heavily-populated&nbsp;with buildings!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fear-of-Snakes</strong></p><p>An early lesson I learnt the hard way was that, like many humans, horses fear snakes. While training one morning, a snake glided across us. On seeing the snake, Majestic turned back and took off straight for the stables some 3kms away with his mouth wide opened and head in the sky. That day, I understood practically the theory&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Banerjee taught us&nbsp;in Physics at school about what “horsepower” meant. With a horse’s strength of more than ten humans combined, no amount of pulling with all my strength could stop him from speeding to the stables. Bad as I thought the snake experience was, it was to prove beneficial later.</p><p>During the rehearsals at the Black-Star-Square, I warned the Information Services/GBC journalists not to bring any cable close to me as Majestic would take it for a snake. Unfortunately, on the D-Day&nbsp;7th&nbsp;January 2000, a gentleman came out of an Information Services vehicle with a cable-roll. Anticipating he was going to throw it in my direction, I quickly jerked Majestic’s head 45 degrees in the opposite direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Immediately he saw the cable thrown, Majestic reared on its hind legs and attempted to take off to his favorite destination for his victims, the Marine-Drive beach behind the Black-Star-Square. My anticipation paid off when he only succeeded in bringing me to my original position, at great cost to my left shoulder, my sword being in my right hand.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sense-of-Smell</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Until my very close encounter with Majestic, I did not know that, like dogs, horses have a strong sense-of-smell, though to a lesser degree. My instructor told me&nbsp;they could tell every morning when I was about 3-kms away from the stable. On picking my scent, an excited Majestic would start flapping his ears knowing his sugar would soon arrive. My “Manager” later complained that, Majestic ate all the sugar in our home! My day with Majestic ended with me giving him&nbsp;round-two&nbsp;of sugar before we parted company.</p><p><br></p><p>Just before I mounted him on 7th January 2000 for the communication-gadgets to be fixed on me, I put my arms around his neck/mane and said,&nbsp;</p><p>“Majestic, today is our final day. Be a good boy and let’s have a good parade!”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>To my surprise, Majestic nodded in acknowledgement. For a confirmation, I repeated what I said and he again acknowledged it with a nod. The Millennium parade started at 9am, and three hours later, Majestic and I trotted off the Black-Star-Square tired, but happy with ourselves from the thunderous applause we received.</p><p>Like dogs, horses can be very loving and affectionate. Majestic and I remained friends until he died in March 2010 of&nbsp;old-age&nbsp;at 30, which translated into human age of about 90 years.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I&nbsp;have been asked&nbsp;if horses are dangerous. Generally, they are not. However, if approached from the rear, horses sense danger of&nbsp;being attacked. Their hind legs can be a dangerous/fatal weapon when they kick,&nbsp;considering their immense strength. One must therefore always approach a horse from the front, and never from the rear.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Discussion</strong></p><p>7th&nbsp;January&nbsp;2026&nbsp;brought memories&nbsp;of my role in&nbsp;the drafting of Ghana’s&nbsp;Fourth Republican Constitution&nbsp;(1992), and&nbsp;as Parade Commander for the “Millennium-Parade” (2000).</p><p><br></p><p>Fellow Ghanaians, if animals like Majestic my parade-horse, and pets like dogs can&nbsp;be so loving, why do we&nbsp;treat one another with so much disrespect/hatred/cruelty simply because of different viewpoints? Again, why all the corruption/greed manifesting in “galamsey” poisoning/destroying the environment and human lives when very few of us will live to the 90-years Majestic lived?</p><p><br></p><p>May Ghanaians learn from the majestic nature of my parade-horse Majestic, and make peace!&nbsp;Let us live in peace in 2026&nbsp;and beyond!&nbsp;God bless our homeland Ghana.</p><p><br></p><p>Leadership,&nbsp;lead&nbsp;by example!

Or they were not finished or at speed or abreast of the issue,” Khalid stated.\n\nWatch the video below:</p><p>\"The longer he [Ken Ofori-Atta] stays abroad, the more he fuels public debate.\"\n\n- Sharif Khalid [Economic Advisor to the Vice President] #Newsfile\n\nWatch the livestream here: https://t.co/JgfEk81RhC pic.twitter.com/BJ2eOwwINH</p>"

      "content": "<p>Nigerian singer Paul Okoye, popularly known as Rudeboy, has advised people against idolizing relationships following news that popular American influencer couple Kristy and Desmond Scott are divorcing after more than a decade of marriage.</p><p>Speaking on Sunday via social media, the Grammy nominated musician reacted to reports that Kristy Scott filed for divorce from her husband Desmond, citing alleged infidelity as the reason for ending their 11 year union. The news shocked millions of fans who followed the couple’s wholesome family content across social media platforms.</p><p>Rudeboy’s comments highlighted a recurring theme in celebrity and influencer culture, where public displays of affection and seemingly perfect relationships often mask private struggles. He cautioned followers against placing relationships on pedestals based solely on curated social media portrayals.</p><p>Kristy, known professionally as Kristy Sarah on Instagram and TikTok, submitted formal divorce paperwork on December 30, 2025, in Harris County, Texas, where the couple built much of their brand. Court documents obtained by TMZ state that alleged infidelity completely wiped out any reasonable chance of reconciliation.</p><p>The Scotts met as teenagers at age 14 in middle school and married in 2014. They share two sons, Vance and Westin, who frequently appeared in their family oriented content. The couple built a massive following with approximately 16 million followers on TikTok, over five million subscribers on YouTube, and millions more on Instagram.</p><p>Their content featured lighthearted family moments, home renovation projects, prank videos, and lifestyle vlogs. Kristy became known for testing designer heels through acrobatic stunts including flips, cartwheels, and dancing, while Desmond showcased his culinary skills as a chef. The couple’s playful dynamic and seemingly authentic family moments resonated with audiences seeking relatable yet aspirational content.</p><p>Kristy’s entrepreneurial success earned her recognition on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list in 2023 for social media. The couple reportedly co owns Meant To Be Films, a wedding videography and storytelling production company. Kristy also launched a clothing line called Vayra and a personalized productivity planner.</p><p>Their last joint social media post appeared in early December 2025, weeks before the divorce filing became public. Fans had begun noticing Desmond’s absence from Kristy’s recent content, sparking speculation about potential relationship troubles before the official announcement.</p><p>On Saturday, January 11, 2026, Desmond Scott addressed the situation publicly through an Instagram statement. He apologized to Kristy, their family, and fans affected by the public attention surrounding their separation.</p><p>Desmond explained that he and Kristy faced challenges in 2025 and made sincere efforts to work through them. He stated that toward the end of 2025, he wanted to separate and had conversations with Kristy regarding this decision. During this period, Desmond admitted he made choices that I am not proud of, adding that he took responsibility for those actions, shared this with Kristy directly, and ultimately they decided to divorce.</p><p>While Desmond did not explicitly confirm the infidelity allegations in his statement, his acknowledgment of making choices he regrets appeared to validate aspects of Kristy’s claims. He emphasized that Kristy would always remain his priority as the mother of his children and stated his commitment to being an active, present, and loving parent to their sons.</p><p>Kristy has not issued a public statement beyond the court filing. As divorce proceedings continue, the couple will no longer live together as husband and wife. The paperwork indicates they intend to finalize the dissolution of their marriage soon.</p><p>The split represents one of the most prominent influencer breakups in early 2026, joining a trend of high profile separations. Real Housewives of Atlanta alum Brit Eady announced her divorce from husband Michael Cunningham after five years of marriage, while several other celebrity couples ended relationships at the close of 2025.</p><p>Fans expressed disbelief across social media platforms, with many questioning their faith in love and relationships. Comments reflected shock that a couple who appeared so happy and authentic could be facing such serious allegations. The revelation underscored the gap between public personas carefully crafted for social media and private realities that remain hidden from followers.</p><p>Rudeboy’s warning resonates beyond this specific case, addressing broader issues about parasocial relationships and the dangers of measuring personal relationships against idealized versions presented online. The singer, who experienced his own public marital challenges and eventual separation, brings personal understanding to his cautionary message.</p><p>The divorce also raises questions about the sustainability of relationship based content creation, where couples monetize their personal lives and romantic partnerships become business ventures. When relationships deteriorate, couples face the dual challenge of navigating private heartbreak while managing public brands built on their union.</p><p>Industry observers note that influencer couples often face unique pressures as their relationships become entertainment products subject to constant scrutiny. The need to maintain consistent content output while preserving privacy creates tension, particularly when facing marital difficulties.</p><p>The Scott’s situation demonstrates how social media success can complicate already difficult personal situations. With millions invested emotionally in their story, the couple must balance protecting their children and managing their own healing while addressing public interest in their separation.</p><p>Neither party has commented on how they will handle their shared business ventures or divide their substantial social media assets. The couple’s joint brand represents significant financial value, making their divorce potentially complex beyond typical marital dissolution proceedings.</p><p>As the story continues developing, Rudeboy’s advice serves as a reminder that social media presentations rarely capture complete truths about relationships. His call to avoid idolizing couples based on curated content reflects growing awareness about the performative nature of online personas.</p>"

The plan will focus on athletes, governance, funding, and partnerships to ensure Team Ghana becomes a competitive force in African and global sports.</p><p>The core pillars of the plan included enhanced funding mechanisms, a rigorous talent identification and development pathway, improved sports infrastructure, and a robust athlete welfare program covering education and post-career transition.</p><p>“This holistic approach recognised that an athlete’s success is deeply intertwined with their overall well-being and stability. The Federation Heads were specifically tasked with adapting these national pillars to their respective sporting disciplines.</p><p>Mr Richard Akpokavie Esq., GOC President, said the committee is committed to putting athletes at the centre of all activities and providing federations with the tools to succeed.</p><p>“This plan provides a clear roadmap for advancing sports development in Ghana. We are not just aiming for medals; we are building a system where every athlete succeeds, and every federation thrives,” he said.</p><p>“For too long, our success has been a sporadic flash of brilliance followed by long periods of struggle,” he declared. “This four-year plan is our promise to the nation, a commitment to building a solid, resilient structure. ‘We are moving beyond wishful thinking, we are implementing a foundation for excellence that will endure long after this committee’s tenure,'” he stated.</p><p>Dr. Fred Awaah, Board Chairman of the National Sports Authority, commended the GOC for integrating science into sports and for showing how sports contribute to national development, employment, and economic growth.</p><p>“Many people see sports only as entertainment. But it drives jobs, boosts the economy, and strengthens the nation,” Dr Awaah said.</p><p>The NSA Board Chairman acknowledged the comprehensive nature of the plan and pledged the support of the National Sports Authority (NSA) in its execution. “The NSA stands ready to collaborate on the infrastructural and policy fronts,” Dr Awaah confirmed. “‘This strategic plan aligns perfectly with the national agenda to treat sports as a serious industry, and we will provide the necessary governmental backing,'” he asserted.</p><p>The comprehensive, four-year strategic plan is designed to carve a path for sustainable sports success in the nation. It is a deeply considered, long-term blueprint aimed at influencing the performance of Team Ghana.</p><p>Mr Mohammed Muniru Kassim, the Secretary General of the Ghana Olympic Committee, underscored the need for unity and administrative rigour. “This plan represents months of consultation, sweat, and shared vision,” he announced, “Today marks the transition from planning to action, and every federation head and athlete representative here is fundamental to its success,” he declared.</p><p>Senior vice president of GOC, Mr Mawuko Afadzinu, urged federations to follow GOC’s example to access government sports funding, stressing the need for proper documentation and clear strategic plans.</p><p>Mr Chris Essilfie, Consultant and Member of the Commonwealth Sport Ethics Commission, provided the justification for the new strategy. “Ghanaian talent has never been the issue,” Mr Essilfie stated pointedly. “‘The true hurdle has been consistency in governance and ensuring world-class ethical standards. This new strategy directly addresses those structural gaps,'” he emphasised, reminding federations that integrity was foundational to sustainability.</p><p>“‘This strategy is the lifeline we needed. It gives the young athletes of today a structured future, ensuring that raw talent doesn’t go to waste,'” Md. Rafstu Inusa, President of Ghana Rugby, her emotional words bringing the plan’s human element to the fore.</p><p>Federations were urged to follow GOC’s example to access government sports funding, stressing the need for proper documentation and clear strategic plans.</p>"

Continuing students were reported to be paying roughly 27 percent more.</p><p>Dr Apaak earlier explained that the ministry’s intervention was unavoidable.</p><p>“The level of public outcry from students and parents was such that we couldn’t have ignored it,” he said on Citi FM’s Eyewitness News.</p><p>He stressed that any fee adjustment must comply with the Fees and Charges Act, noting that Parliament had not approved an increase.</p><p>“Given that we work with laws and there are processes and procedures, the best thing was to instruct GTEC to call the university to stay any increase,” he added.</p><p>The University of Ghana, through Pro Vice-Chancellor Prof. Awandare, has maintained that the disputed charges were largely third-party fees approved by student leadership rather than management-imposed academic fees.</p><p>“What is in the report is about third-party fees which were imposed by the student leadership,” he said, arguing that rising utility costs made some adjustments unavoidable.</p><p>GTEC, however, has taken a firm regulatory position. In a January 5, 2026 letter to the Vice-Chancellor, the commission ordered an immediate reversal of all fee increases and newly introduced charges made without statutory approval.</p><p>It directed refunds for final-year students who overpaid and credits for continuing students, while reverting all dues, including SRC and GRASSAG charges, to last academic year’s approved rates.</p><p>“You are hereby requested to provide GTEC with evidence of compliance not later than January 12, 2026,” the commission warned, cautioning that failure would attract serious regulatory sanctions.</p><p>The UGSRC has previously attempted to justify some third-party fee adjustments, citing administrative errors, higher utility bills and the need to finance a proposed SRC hostel project.</p><p>SRC President Larbi Ofori Richmond said an additional ₵200 levy was intended to support long-term accommodation needs, adding that the planned facility could house about 15,000 students at affordable rates.</p><p>Thursday’s meeting is expected to harmonise these competing positions and ease tensions as stakeholders work toward a solution that balances student welfare and adherence to the law.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The government is transforming the 24 Hour Economy Secretariat into a full statutory Authority, bringing Ghana closer to operationalizing a round the clock economic model aimed at boosting productivity, job creation, and investment across sectors.</p><p>President John Dramani Mahama announced Thursday during a visit to the Ghana Publishing Company that Cabinet has approved the 24 Hour Economy Authority Bill for submission to Parliament. Once enacted, the Authority will replace the existing secretariat and widen the scope of activities supporting continuous business operations nationwide.</p><p>“I’m happy to note that the committee has finished considering it and it’s supposed to go onto the floor of Parliament to set up the 24 Hour Authority, which would then open the way for implementation and registration of all the businesses that will be involved in the 24 hour economy initiative,” the President stated.</p><p>The new Authority is expected to serve as the central coordinating body for the policy’s implementation, regulating participating businesses, setting operational standards, and administering incentives to encourage extended operations. The President explained that the Authority will clearly spell out incentives available to businesses that sign on to the initiative, with early adopters like Ghana Publishing Company positioned to benefit significantly.</p><p>The 24 Hour Economy initiative, which was launched nationally in July 2025, is designed to expand Ghana’s productive base beyond the traditional eight hour workday, fostering new avenues of growth in manufacturing, logistics, services, and agriculture.</p><p>Government spokesman Felix Ofosu Kwakye revealed that the initiative has received a budget allocation of GHS110 million to support operationalization. He explained the program requires government systems and incentives to thrive, noting that substantive undertakings necessitate proper manpower and established ground rules.</p><p>Several large public institutions are already experimenting with extended operations. The Ghana Publishing Company has adopted a two shift model, while the Passport Office and Ghana’s foreign missions have rolled out round the clock services. Both Tema and Takoradi ports now operate 24 hours to boost trade efficiency and reduce congestion.</p><p>The Ministry of Interior has established a dedicated 24 hour economy policing secretariat to provide continuous security support across the country. Cabinet has also approved amendments to the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC) Act and the Labour Act to accommodate the new economic model, addressing worker protection while creating incentives for businesses to extend operational hours.</p><p>Minister of Youth Development and Empowerment George Opare Addo emphasized that complete implementation is realistically expected by the end of 2026, acknowledging that the transition requires significant legislative and structural shifts. “Everyone who is honest will see that the work is meeting expectations and we are on track,” he stated.</p><p>However, business readiness remains mixed. While large institutions report early benefits such as improved service delivery and better infrastructure use, many small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) caution that operating around the clock requires significant shifts in cost structures, labour strategies, and demand forecasting.</p><p>Extended hours mean higher electricity bills, increased staffing needs, and security concerns, particularly for informal traders and microbusiness owners who typically operate within daylight hours. Many businesses have expressed concerns about the performance of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) and Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL), noting that electricity and water services remain unreliable in several areas.</p><p>The Food and Beverages Association of Ghana (FABAG) recently described ECG and GWCL as major obstacles to economic development, noting chronic mismanagement, corruption, and inadequate service delivery. The association warned that recent utility tariff increases would place additional strain on businesses already facing high operational costs, potentially forcing SMEs to close, reduce employment, or raise prices.</p><p>Low quality service has been the leading complaint against both utilities. Between January and October 2024, the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) received 1,477 complaints out of 1,891 total complaints centered on subpar service delivery. Customers reported power outages, phase offs, low voltage, irregular water supply, discolored water, burst pipes, and low water pressure.</p><p>ECG reported a 23 percent transmission loss in 2023, impacting affordability and accessibility. Frequent power outages have historically affected businesses, with the African Development Bank indicating that Ghana loses approximately $2.1 billion annually due to unreliable electricity supply.</p><p>To address infrastructure concerns, the proposed Authority is expected to offer a certification programme, access to financing, and targeted incentives for businesses ready to adopt round the clock operations. According to the official 24H+ programme portal, certified businesses may unlock financing, tax benefits, and expert training, elements critical for competitiveness in a 24 hour market environment.</p><p>The initiative complements broader economic transformation efforts, including export development and industrialization, with government projections suggesting the potential to create millions of jobs and stimulate both local and foreign investment. The policy connects directly to employment generation programs like the One Million Coders Programme, which is training young Ghanaians for digital jobs.</p><p>President Mahama revealed that the 24 hour economy concept extends to local development, with new expenditure guidelines for District Assembly Common Fund allocations requiring 25 percent of funds to support infrastructure that enables continuous economic activity.</p><p>Residents of Ashaiman expressed mixed reactions to the implementation. John Ekow, an airline staff member, noted that some public institutions had already adopted round the clock operations, while Gideon Ayinedenaba, a social media manager, described the policy as a positive initiative that could absorb significant numbers of unemployed youth while increasing production.</p><p>Ghana’s success in this economic transformation hinges on several key factors, including infrastructure reliability, labour market adaptation, demand stimulation, and security measures to protect workers and customers at all hours. For many Ghanaian businesses, the transition raises questions about cost viability, consumer behavior after traditional business hours, and access to financing and incentives.</p><p>The government maintains that the 24 Hour Economy has high potential to unlock productivity and generate jobs, particularly among youth and in sectors like logistics, manufacturing, and services. However, critics argue that without addressing fundamental infrastructure challenges, particularly in electricity and water supply, the ambitious policy may struggle to achieve its objectives.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The Obuasi Carpenters Association has raised concerns about the destruction of forest reserves through illegal mining, popularly known as galamsey, warning that widespread deforestation is severely affecting their livelihoods due to a growing shortage of timber.</p><p>The concerns were expressed during the official launch of the association and the inauguration of its newly elected executives in Obuasi in the Ashanti Region.</p><p>Speaking to Adom News, Chairman of the Association, Rev. Isaac Boateng, described galamsey-driven deforestation as a major threat to the survival of the carpentry industry in the area. He said local carpenters are often prevented from harvesting timber for their work, while individuals from other regions are allegedly granted access, a situation he described as worrying.</p><p>Rev. Boateng appealed to authorities to prioritise Obuasi-based carpenters when awarding contracts, rather than engaging artisans from outside the municipality. He also called on the government to take urgent action against galamsey operators who, he said, are destroying forest reserves and depriving carpenters of their raw materials.</p><p>Some members of the association also lamented that access to mature timber has become increasingly difficult due to the destruction of forests. They explained that the immature wood now available is unsuitable for carpentry work, as it deteriorates easily after use.</p><p>Others expressed concern about the future of the industry, noting that many young people are abandoning carpentry to engage in galamsey activities, even when apprenticeship opportunities are offered free of charge.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Indonesia has become the first country to block Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot over concerns that the artificial intelligence tool is generating explicit deepfake imagery, including depictions of women and children.</p><p>The Communications and Digital Affairs Ministry announced the temporary ban on Saturday, describing the practice as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and citizen security in the digital space.</p><p>Minister Meutya Hafid stated the government was taking action to protect women, children, and the public from the risks of fake pornographic content generated using artificial intelligence technology. The ministry has summoned X officials to discuss the matter.</p><p>The move comes after governments and regulators from Europe to Asia condemned and opened inquiries into sexualized content generated by the application. XAI, the startup behind Grok, said Thursday it had restricted image generation and editing to paying subscribers while working to fix safeguard lapses that allowed sexualized outputs, including depictions of scantily clad children.</p><p>Reports indicate Grok produced approximately 6,700 explicit images per hour during a 24 hour analysis period, which is 85 times more than the five leading deepfake websites combined. The chatbot’s image editing feature allowed users to alter online photos to remove clothing, creating explicit images with disturbing efficiency.</p><p>Ashley St. Clair, the mother of one of Musk’s children, reported that when she asked Grok to stop creating sexually explicit images of her, including some based on photos from when she was 14, the bot responded that the content was humorous and continued generating more explicit images.</p><p>CBS News verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as United States First Lady Melania Trump.</p><p>The United Kingdom government has also taken a firm stance on the issue. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday he wants all options on the table, including a potential ban on X in Britain, calling the situation disgraceful, disgusting, and not to be tolerated.</p><p>Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said Ofcom’s next steps on Grok should come in days, not weeks, adding that the regulator has the government’s full backing to take action, which could include fines of £18 million. She noted that the Online Safety Act enables Ofcom to block services from being made available to people in the UK.</p><p>A Downing Street spokesperson described the move to limit the AI tool’s features to paying subscribers as insulting to victims and not a solution, stating it simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.</p><p>Ofcom urgently made contact with X on Monday and set a firm deadline, to which it received a response. The regulator is now undertaking an expedited assessment as a matter of urgency.</p><p>The European Union ordered X to preserve all documents related to Grok’s image generation until December 31, 2026. India’s IT ministry ordered xAI to take action to prevent Grok from generating obscene content.</p><p>Musk shared an AI generated image of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a bikini, commenting that they just want to suppress free speech. In response to criticism, Musk wrote they want any excuse for censorship.</p><p>Musk stated last week that anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content. When contacted by media outlets, xAI responded with an automatic message stating Legacy Media Lies without elaborating further.</p><p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz said many of the recent AI generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of his legislation, now law, the Take It Down Act, as well as X’s terms and conditions. He added that unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims’ privacy and dignity and should be taken down with guardrails put in place.</p><p>Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the UK government if Starmer moved to ban X in the UK. She stated she would move forward with legislation currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer but Britain as a whole.</p><p>Indonesia, which has strict online obscenity laws, represents the most aggressive governmental response so far to the controversy. The temporary block prevents Indonesian citizens from accessing the Grok application while authorities evaluate next steps.</p><p>XAI has defended its decision to restrict image generation to paying subscribers, arguing that requiring users to submit identifying information and payment details would deter anonymous abuse. Critics counter that monetizing access to tools capable of creating illegal content fails to address fundamental safety concerns.</p><p>The Internet Watch Foundation has warned that criminal actors are already exploiting the feature to produce child sexual abuse material. Although full image generation is now gated behind paid access, free users can still manipulate photos through X’s edit image tools and through Grok’s standalone website.</p><p>X’s Safety account stated the platform takes action against illegal content, including Child Sexual Abuse Material, by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary. The account added that anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.</p><p>The Indonesian government’s framing is significant, as classifying explicit deepfakes as violations of human rights, dignity, and security elevates the issue beyond platform policy failures into fundamental rights violations. This linguistic shift strengthens the legal and moral foundation for regulatory intervention.</p><p>The controversy highlights growing tensions between artificial intelligence innovation, content moderation, and government oversight. While Grok was designed to offer less restricted image generation compared to competitors like DALL-E and Midjourney, critics argue the lack of safeguards has enabled industrial scale abuse.</p><p>The case could set precedents for how governments worldwide approach AI regulation, particularly concerning tools that can generate explicit or harmful content. Indonesia’s decisive action may encourage other nations to pursue similar restrictions if platforms fail to implement adequate protections.</p>"

However, compared with Lagos’ founder density, Nairobi’s engineering depth and Cape Town’s infrastructure advantage, Accra continues to face constraints around advanced technical skills, enterprise-grade digital reliability and investor participation.</p><p>Accra is entering a defining phase as a start-up city,” said Nicholas Michael, Group Head of Market Development at Multipolitan. “Its stability and quality of life are now part of a stronger global story, and that narrative draws founders and investors”</p><p>While broadband access is improving, inconsistent uptime and limited high-capacity infrastructure still require many founders to plan around connectivity gaps. Skills shortages persist in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and deep tech engineering, limiting the city’s ability to scale globally competitive products at speed.</p><p>Despite these constraints, Accra’s quality of life is a real advantage. Its safety, cultural vibrancy, and ease of living continue to draw founders who want a more stable base to build from. More founders are choosing cities that reduce daily friction: straightforward business setup, clearer rules, dependable digital services, and predictable operating conditions. Accra may not yet have the venture gravity of legacy hubs, but it can compound these strengths into a defensible edge.</p><p>For investors, the implication is simple: in a world where talent is increasingly mobile and more professionals can work location-independently, founder migration is being driven as much by operational leverage as by access to capital. The Index suggests Accra has a credible shot at becoming West Africa’s stable tech capital. The outcome will depend less on headline valuations and more on whether infrastructure, policy, and talent development can keep pace with the city’s entrepreneurial momentum.</p><p>Multipolitan is the platform for borderless living.

Bwalya appeared before Lusaka magistrate Kawama Mwamfuli on Thursday and pleaded not guilty to unlawful wounding charges.</p><p>According to the police complaint filed by Mwanza, the incident occurred around 2:00 a.m. when his wife allegedly began speaking on the phone with a man while they were in bed together. The bishop stated he heard her arranging for the man to escort her to Nalusanga, where she planned to acquire cattle.</p><p>Mwanza told investigators that he grabbed the phone from his wife and questioned why she was speaking with another man in his presence and inside their home. Bwalya allegedly responded by calling her husband foolish and saying she would show him.</p><p>The bishop’s account claims his wife picked up a broomstick and attempted to strike him, but he blocked the blow. Bwalya then allegedly retrieved the bedroom keys, unlocked the door, and returned with a knife before locking them both inside.</p><p>According to the complaint, Bwalya stabbed Mwanza in the hands and head. When he attempted to escape, she allegedly struck him in the back and grabbed his genitals. Mwanza managed to retrieve the keys after they fell from her hands, escaped the bedroom, and locked his wife inside before reporting the incident to authorities.</p><p>The matter has been adjourned until January 22, 2026, when the case will resume at the Lusaka Magistrates Court.

Approximately two weeks before this hearing, a Lusaka woman received a six-month jail sentence for pouring hot water on her husband following an argument.</p><p>Gender-based violence remains a significant concern in Zambia, affecting both women and men, though women comprise the majority of victims. Domestic violence cases involving physical assault, emotional abuse, and other forms of harm continue to appear regularly in Zambian courts.</p><p>The legal process will now determine whether prosecutors can prove the assault allegations beyond reasonable doubt. If convicted of unlawful wounding, Bwalya could face penalties including imprisonment under Zambian criminal law.</p><p>Both parties are expected to present evidence and testimony when proceedings resume later this month.

      "content": "<p>Ghanaian rapper Kofi Mole has criticised the growing tendency to use Azonto as an insult for music considered outdated, questioning why a genre that once represented national identity is now being dismissed and mislabelled.</p><p>Speaking on Luv FM’s DriveTimeOnLuv show with host Melvin, the Don’t Be Late hitmaker reacted to comments suggesting he should abandon Azonto music. He challenged critics who now refer to the genre dismissively, asking why something that defined Ghana’s sound has become synonymous with inferior music.</p><p>“Someone said I should stop doing Azonto music,” he recalled. “I asked: Why is Azonto suddenly ‘Indian music’? That’s our identity.”</p><p>Azonto, a subgenre of Hiplife that went viral in the early 2010s, helped project Ghana’s music onto the global stage before fading from mainstream prominence. Kofi Mole argued that Ghana missed a critical opportunity to establish Azonto as its signature sound, blaming premature abandonment by the industry and listeners.</p><p>“Azonto could have been our global sound,” he stated. “That was our identity and we put it in the trash.”</p><p>The rapper pointed to what he sees as a destructive pattern in Ghana’s music industry: constantly chasing new trends before existing sounds can mature and gain international traction. According to him, this cycle prevents local genres from developing the staying power needed for global recognition.</p><p>“We move on too fast,” he said. “Before a sound can grow, people say it’s old and force artists to chase the next thing.”</p><p>Kofi Mole drew comparisons with other African and Caribbean nations that have successfully built globally recognizable musical brands around specific genres. He cited Nigeria’s dominance with Afrobeats, South Africa’s ownership of Amapiano, and Jamaica’s enduring reggae legacy.</p><p>“Nigeria is known for Afrobeats. South Africa owns Amapiano. Jamaica owns reggae,” he explained. “But Ghana? We don’t have that one sound the world knows us for.”</p><p>The musician also lamented the lack of structure and unity within Ghana’s music industry, describing an environment where artists operate in isolation without feeling connected to a broader collective vision.</p><p>“Ghana music is supposed to be booming more than this, but something is wrong,” he said. “Everybody is on their own. I don’t even feel an industry vibe.”</p><p>He criticised the absence of clear systems, noting that promotions are driven largely by goodwill rather than dependable structures, making the entertainment business unnecessarily unstable.</p><p>Kofi Mole also addressed the emotional toll that online criticism takes on artists, explaining how negative commentary can discourage musicians from developing distinctive sounds. He suggested that constant ridicule on social media platforms discourages artistic experimentation and pushes creators toward safer, more commercially acceptable choices.</p><p>“You can work all day in the studio, then someone wakes up online to trash your work,” he said. “That alone can make artists abandon the sound.”</p><p>The rapper urged musicians and music fans to reclaim Azonto with pride, describing it as a core part of Ghana’s musical identity that deserves preservation rather than mockery. He expressed concern that Ghana’s music culture has become overly sensationalized, with trends fading quickly and entire eras being discarded.</p><p>While acknowledging that Ghana’s music industry has achieved some success, Kofi Mole insists the country is underperforming relative to its cultural influence and geographic position. He argued that Ghana’s status as a gateway to Africa should translate into stronger musical dominance.</p><p>“We are doing well, but we are supposed to be doing way better,” he said. “Ghana is the gateway to Africa. Our music should reflect that power.”</p><p>His comments have reignited debate within Ghana’s entertainment circles about why the country, despite producing internationally successful artists and pioneering various genres, has struggled to establish a defining global sound comparable to its regional competitors.</p><p>Some industry observers agree that Ghana’s quick adoption of new trends reflects creativity but also prevents consolidation around signature sounds. Others defend the approach, arguing that musical evolution requires experimentation rather than rigid attachment to specific genres.</p><p>The conversation comes as younger Ghanaian artists increasingly blend multiple influences, from drill and trap to highlife and gospel, creating hybrid sounds that resist easy categorization but may lack the unified identity Kofi Mole advocates for.</p><p>Kofi Mole rose to prominence with hits including Don’t Be Late, Mensah, and Odobra. He has consistently incorporated Azonto elements into his music despite shifting industry trends.</p>"

Rather, it is grounded strictly in constitutional order, regulatory coherence, prudential soundness, consumer protection, and public interest considerations,” A4CG noted.\n\nAccording to the group, the draft guideline suffers from “material internal contradictions, technical gaps, and prudential risks” that create legal uncertainty and compliance challenges. A4CG argued that the Bank of Ghana “lacks its own tried and tested Non-Interest Banking and Finance model it intends to introduce in Ghana hence the inherent contradictions in the draft exposure”.\n\nAmong its key concerns, A4CG pointed to what it described as regulatory incoherence within the draft, including “conflicting hierarchies of applicable standards”, “inconsistent dispute-resolution pathways”, and an “unclear allocation of supervisory authority between BoG and internal committees”.\n\nThe group also raised alarm over the creation of internal governance and adjudicatory bodies — the Non-Interest Banking Advisory Committee (NIBAC) and the Non-Interest Finance Advisory Committee (NIFAC) — which it said could undermine existing consumer protection frameworks.\n\n“The Draft establishes internal bodies (NIBAC and NIFAC) with adjudicatory-type functions that displace standard consumer redress mechanisms applicable to other banks,” the submission stated, warning that this could result in “unequal treatment of bank customers and weakens established regulatory safeguards”.\n\nA4CG further cautioned that the proposed “window” model, which allows conventional banks to operate non-interest banking units, is “operationally complex, cost-opaque, and highly vulnerable to manipulation” due to insufficient accounting, audit and supervisory detail.\n\nOn market justification, the group said the draft fails to adequately demonstrate demand or systemic benefit. It noted that “serious questions” remain about “whether there is sufficient unmet demand in Ghana to justify the regulatory and supervisory overheads of a specialised non-interest banking regime”.\n\nIn its conclusion, A4CG formally requested that the Exposure Draft be withdrawn and substantially revised.\n\n“The Exposure Draft, as currently constituted, is internally inconsistent, operationally fragile, and legally vulnerable,” it said, adding that “it should therefore be withdrawn and re-issued following comprehensive technical revision”.\n\nThe group emphasised that any future framework must “preserve constitutional neutrality, ensure equal consumer protection, maintain BoG’s supervisory primacy, avoid parallel adjudicatory systems, and address prudential and accounting realities before permitting window operations”.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Host, Badwam on Adom TV</p><p><br></p><p>Over the years, I have come to a firm realisation about Ghana’s electoral dynamics: once a political party is able to properly govern and satisfy its core support base, it stands a very strong chance of winning a general election.</p><p><br></p><p> The reality is that the majority of registered voters in Ghana are politically aligned. Only a relatively small fraction can genuinely be described as so-called floating or undecided voters.</p><p><br></p><p>This position is informed not only by observation but also by direct engagement with key political actors and thinkers. I was privileged to be the first, if not the only, broadcaster to interview the late Professor Kwesi Botchwey after the committee he chaired presented its findings on the factors that led to the National Democratic Congress (NDC) losing the 2016 general election to the New Patriotic Party (NPP).</p><p><br></p><p>During his appearance on my programme on Kasapa FM, Professor Botchwey was emphatic in his assessment. He stated clearly that the NDC’s core supporters were deeply unhappy with how party faithful were treated while the party was in power. That dissatisfaction within the base, he explained, significantly contributed to the party’s defeat.</p><p><br></p><p>Fast forward to recent events, and similar sentiments are now being expressed in attempts to explain why the NPP also suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the NDC. The recurring thread in these electoral outcomes is strikingly consistent: greed, complacency, and neglect of party supporters once political power is secured.</p><p>Both the NPP and the NDC must therefore guard against self-deception. There is no vast, mysterious pool of undecided voters waiting to swing elections at the last minute. Electoral victories in Ghana are largely determined by how well political parties manage, respect, and sustain their own bases.</p><p><br></p><p>Political parties must be more deliberate and intentional in ensuring that their supporters feel valued, included, and catered for. Doing so places them just an inch away from electoral victory.</p><p><br></p><p>It is also crucial to recognise that party supporters are not necessarily blind loyalists. Many are discerning and engage in critical assessment of their own party’s performance while in government. When disappointed, such supporters may either vote against their party or abstain entirely from the electoral process.</p><p><br></p><p>In the end, elections are not lost or won merely in the swing regions or among floating voters; they are often decided at home, within a party’s own support base. How that base is treated while in power may ultimately determine a party’s political future.</p>"

Dr. Tiah Abdul-Kabiru Mahama, one of the darling boys of Dr. Bawumia, as follows:</p><p>A company’s profile or business details are assessed based on its Principal Activity and Objects of the Company, not solely on its Nature of Business/Sector.</p><p>The Nature of Business/Sector reflects the primary aim of a company within a specific economic activity, while the Principal Activity and Objects of the Company address specific secondary activities and broader objectives. These allow room for future expansion, especially where the company’s vision spans multiple economic sectors.</p><p><br></p><p>The ISIC Code is a global classification system recommended by the United Nations Statistical Commission for categorising economic activities and businesses by their primary activity. It is used by the United Nations and countries worldwide, including Ghana, for economic statistics, administration, data gathering, and analysis. Its purpose is to standardise industrial data for comparison and policy-making.</p><p><br></p><p>A careful scrutiny of the Company Profile/Business Details of Bawa-Rock Ltd (attached below) clearly shows that “Dealers in Precious Minerals” is emphatically captured under both the Objects of the Company and its Principal Activity.</p><p><br></p><p>So what justification does the Walewale Member of Parliament have for lying that Bawa-Rock was set up solely for farming/fishing? You may lie to your gullible followers, but please do so with dignity and integrity, considering the fact that you are a PhD holder and an Honourable Member of Parliament.</p><p><br></p><p>Bawa-Rock Ltd was licensed by the NPP government as a Licensed Gold Buyer on three separate occasions:</p><p>(a) 15th February 2019 – 14th February 2020</p><p>(b) 20th October 2022 – 19th October 2023</p><p><br></p><p>(c) 16th August 2024 – 15th August 2025</p><p><br></p><p>I therefore ask Hon. Dr. Tiah Abdul-Kabiru Mahama this simple question: Was the NPP government so incompetent that it licensed a company supposedly set up for farming/fishing as a gold buyer? Or was the CEO of the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC) under our government also too incompetent to identify that Bawa-Rock was merely a farming/fishing company?</p><p><br></p><p>Per his own statement and the evidence he shared on Facebook, Hon. Dr. Tiah Abdul-Kabiru Mahama admitted that Bawa-Rock was registered in 2015. Why then did they lie to Ghanaians that Bawa-Rock was registered in February 2025?</p><p><br></p><p>The NPP is already suffering from trust issues; please, and respectfully, let us not compound the problem with lies and intellectual dishonesty.</p><p><br></p><p>The NPP must be rebranded, rebuilt, and repositioned with honesty, truth, credibility, and integrity in order to regain the trust and confidence of the Ghanaian people.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

An expiration is a passive end to a travel document; a revocation is an active cancellation, often triggered by a request from a foreign government or the discovery of disqualifying factors.</p><p>“In June 2025, his visa was revoked; it’s not an expiration of the visa. The information we have is that his visa was revoked. So he has been living in America without a visa,” the Deputy A-G explained.</p><p>He further noted that ICE’s intervention was the logical conclusion of this status: “ICE will not come for you unless you have visa issues; that is what has happened.”</p><p>“We are keenly involved in this matter. We collaborate with law enforcement agencies in this matter,” Dr Srem-Sai affirmed.</p><p>Mr Ofori-Atta’s anticipated return comes at a time when the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) and the Attorney-General are preparing to prosecute high-profile cases involving the Strategic Mobilisation Limited (SML) deal and the controversial National Cathedral project.</p><p>The former minister had been in the U.S. seeking medical treatment, but his legal team—Menka-Premo, Osei-Bonsu, Bruce-Cathline and Partners—now faces the daunting task of preventing his immediate removal.</p><p>While they argue that a “pending petition for adjustment of status” should protect him, Dr Srem-Sai’s revelations about a pre-existing revocation suggest that the U.S. government may have already decided on his status.</p>"

We know we are a developing country and we do not have a lot of resources, but we must begin the dialogue and work together to make inclusive education implementable in our public schools,” she said.</p><p>She disclosed that the research revealed an alarming burden on carers, many of whom are effectively locked out of economic activity and personal development because of their caregiving responsibilities.</p><p>“Most carers of children with developmental disabilities are unable to work or do anything for themselves. Their whole lives revolve around the child and there is no respite for them,” she noted.</p><p>Dr Boateng made a direct appeal to state institutions to take ownership of the issue, calling on the Minister of Education, the Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, the Director-General of the Ghana Education Service and other stakeholders to come together and begin deliberate action rather than endless discussion.</p><p>The dialogue also introduced a proposed action framework known as ARISE — Advocacy, Reform, Inclusion, Support and Empowerment — which organisers say provides a practical roadmap towards building an inclusive society where carers are recognised, supported and empowered rather than neglected.</p><p>This year’s policy dialogue was held under the theme “Promoting Recognition for Unpaid Care Work for Carers of Children with Developmental Disabilities in Ghana,” a subject CDS Africa says must move from the margins of policy debate to the centre of national development planning.</p><p>CDS Africa is a policy think tank focused on democratic governance, social inclusion and sustainable development.</p>"

It involves the use of fine, flexible tubes introduced through blood vessels in the wrist, groin, or other medically indicated access points to reach the heart and cardiovascular system. This technology enables life-saving interventions such as the treatment of myocardial infarction (heart attacks), valve replacements, stent insertions, and numerous other critical cardiac procedures.</p><p>As a young medical doctor, I have witnessed far too often the painful loss of loved ones, friends, and family members to medical emergencies and preventable illnesses, not because their conditions were untreatable, but simply due to the absence of these essential facilities. These are deaths that should never have happened.</p><p>Not long ago, a distinguished emergency physician at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) tragically lost his life to a heart attack. The cruel irony is that the very hospital to which he devoted his life saving countless others lacked the cardiac catheterization equipment that could have saved his own. What a devastating indictment of our system. What a national shame.</p><p>A nation is not worth dying for if it cannot, at its most critical moment, “die” in service to saving the lives of its citizens.</p><p>The initiative to retool major health facilities across the country with cardiac catheterization laboratories and other critical medical equipment under the Ghana Medical Trust Fund (MahamaCares) is nothing short of a masterstroke. It represents the beginning of the end of untimely, preventable, and unfortunate deaths that have, for far too long, been normalized within our healthcare system.</p><p>This initiative and many others anticipated under the Mahamacares policy aligns firmly with President John Dramani Mahama’s vision of a truly citizen-centered healthcare system: one that is reliable, safe, of high quality, and responsive to the real needs of the Ghanaian people.</p><p>For once, hope is not just rhetoric.

SMET is a process, one that builds inventors and innovators instead of the current practice of producing interdisciplinary students and memorizers.”</p><p>APRIL STEM’s critique of STEAM centers on its tendency to merge disciplines without a clear innovation pathway.</p><p>The team argues that this approach dilutes the scientific rigor of education and confuses learners about how knowledge is built and applied.</p><p>“Africa doesn’t need borrowed acronyms,” said Dwomoh-Doyen Benjamin, Co-founder of APRIL, and president of the African Chamber of Content Producers in an interview. “We need systems that reflect our reality and empower learners to build what works.</p><p>Africa must shift from producing consumers of technologies and pivot to creating innovators, inventors, and local content creators who will create solutions for Africa’s unique challenges based on their lived experiences. The time for slogans and acronyms is over. The time for systems has come. Africa must choose SMET”.</p><p>The GSJ paper provides case studies from Worawora Senior High School and other pilot sites, showing measurable gains in cognitive and skill-based outcomes. It also presents historical precedents, from the Wright brothers to local artisans, demonstrating how invention follows the SMET sequence.</p><p>APRIL STEM calls on educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers to adopt SMET as a scalable, culturally grounded framework for Education 4.0 and 5.0. The organization emphasizes that artistic thinking should be recognized as scientific, not isolated as a separate domain.</p><p>“We’re not rejecting the arts as a component of the SMET process,” said Louis Nana Asiedu, Project Coordinator for APRIL-STEM.</p><p>“We are placing it back in science, where it belongs. This explains the growth of sciart, a community merging art and science by connecting their boundaries.”</p><p>Ambassador Prince Kojo Hilton, renowned international arts ambassador and director, in an interview with this reporter added his voice to the conversation: “Would you call Leonardo da Vinci an artist or a scientist? The truth is, he was both.</p><p>Because the arts fall within the domain of science, he was able to navigate both worlds seamlessly. I believe it’s time for artists to start seeing themselves as scientists. After all, the arts can be argued to be a branch of science, just like biology, physics, or any other scientific field.</p><p>Godwin Owusu Frimpong, Director of Instructional and Curriculum Development at APRIL STEM, and Rachel Annoh (PhD), Director of Educational Research and Innovations, reaffirmed their commitment to advancing APRIL STEM’s unique educational models across Africa, with the goal of driving the transformative change the continent urgently requires.</p><p>In her statement, Rachel Annoh (PhD), Director of Educational Research and Innovations at APRIL-STEM stated that Science and Art are creative intersections.</p><p>“Imagine a biologist sketching the delicate patterns of a leaf, a physicist visualizing the swirl of a galaxy, or an engineer crafting a sculpture that defies gravity.</p><p>Art breathes life into data, making the invisible seen, the complex very beautiful, as well making the abstract tangible such that, whether it’s the symmetry of a DNA helix or the chaos of a Jackson Pollock painting, both disciplines fuel curiosity, push boundaries, and remind us that innovation thrives where logic meets imagination”.</p><p>She further revealed that Art in science harmonizes like the piano’s white and black keys.</p><p>“Imagine a painter mastering light like Newton, a musician echoing the rhythm of waves, or a sculptor crafting forms as fluid as a cell’s dance. Science isn’t a formula; it’s a gallery of mysteries waiting to be interpreted.</p><p>The spiral of a galaxy, the curve of a seashell, the pulse of a heartbeat are all nature’s art in motion. Studying this nature is science. Thus, we must artistically grasp scientific concepts, mathematically define problems, engineer solutions, and create technology that simplifies life. That is the SMET we hope to push to revolutionize Africa and the World. Einstein noted that the greatest scientists are artists in their own right. The best science is art” she concluded. APRIL STEM (African Progressive Research and Innovations ) is a Ghana-based organization transforming education through culturally relevant, process-driven models. Its SMET framework empowers learners with practical skills, scientific thinking, and creative problem-solving rooted in African heritage.</p>"

      "content": "<p>President Donald Trump says US companies will now have access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. But the country’s other commodities have also caught his administration’s attention.</p><p>Venezuela has unverified amounts of minerals, metals and potentially rare earth elements, experts say. These raw materials are indispensable for industries from defense to technology, and the administration has repeatedly stressed their importance for US national security.</p><p>But while Washington might aspire to secure Venezuela’s critical elements, it’s a tall order, experts say, and wouldn’t do much to bolster America’s supply chain.</p><p>The quantity and economic viability of Venezuela’s mineral resources are uncertain. Companies also face major risks mining in Venezuela without sustained security guarantees.</p><p>Many of these regions have guerrilla soldiers and armed groups engaging in illegal gold mining, experts say. Energy-intensive rare earths mining can also harm the environment.</p><p>“There is an awareness within the administration that even beyond oil, there’s wider natural resource value in the country,” said Reed Blakemore, director of research at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.</p><p>“However, if we’re talking about the conditions under which we are able to exploit those mineral resources and bring them to market, it’s a much more challenging story,” Blakemore said. “And even, frankly, more challenging than the oil story.”</p><p>Even if US companies were to try to mine Venezuela’s rare earths, getting them out of the ground is just one part of the process. Those materials are usually sent to China for refining.</p><p>China accounted for over 90% of global rare earths refining in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. The country maintains a virtual monopoly in processing and refining the materials due to decades of government subsidies, industry expansion and lax environmental regulations.</p><p>Rare earths have become a major sticking point in US-China trade tensions. Beijing last year implemented some export controls on rare earths during trade spats, raising concerns about America’s lack of secure supply chains for these critical materials.</p><p>“China still holds near-singular capacity to process rare earth metals, and that industrial and geopolitical edge cannot be overcome overnight,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.</p><p>The US Geological Survey designates 60 “critical minerals” vital to economic and national security.</p><p>These critical minerals include a mix of commodities, including aluminum, cobalt, copper, lead and nickel. The list also includes 15 rare earth elements, such as cerium, dysprosium, neodymium and samarium. Rare earths refer to a category of 17 specific metallic elements.</p><p>These commodities are essential inputs in everyday technologies, such as phones, batteries and TV screens, as well as military and defense equipment, such as lasers, fighter jets and missiles.</p><p>“Rare earths” is a misnomer, as the elements are relatively ubiquitous in the Earth’s crust, according to Julie Klinger, geographer and associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison. But extracting them and refining them is the difficult part.</p><p>US lawmakers in recent years have fretted about the country’s reliance on imports for these critical elements. There have been efforts to develop domestic rare earths mining and refining in the United States, but the timeline for projects can take years, if not decades.</p><p>The USGS does not include Venezuela on its list of countries with rare earth elements (countries on the list include China, the United States, Brazil and Greenland, among others).</p><p>Two and a half decades of rule by presidents Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela created a gap in information about the extent of the country’s resources, experts say.</p><p>Still, experts believe Venezuela has deposits of some minerals, such as coltan — of which the metals tantalum and niobium are derived — and bauxite, which can contain aluminum and gallium. Tantalum, niobium, aluminum and gallium are all deemed critical minerals by the USGS.</p><p>In 2009, Chávez touted the country’s natural resources, including “blue gold,” a nickname for coltan. Chávez that year said a large reserve of coltan was discovered in the country, according to Reuters.</p><p>In 2016, Maduro established the Orinoco Mining Arc, a swath of Venezuela designated for mineral exploration and production. But the region has been plagued by illicit mining.</p><p>“While the country sits on large deposits of mineral resources, it is crippled by a combination of poor geological data, low-skilled labor, organized crime, lack of investments and a volatile policy environment,” Sung Choi, metals and mining analyst at BloombergNEF, said in a note.</p><p>“Despite its current geological potential, Venezuela is unlikely to play any meaningful role in the critical minerals sector at least for the next decade,” Choi said.</p>"

This proportion marks a decline compared to the corresponding period in 2024, when the UK corridor contributed 27.6 percent, equivalent to more than one quarter of total inflows,” he said.</p><p><br></p><p>London–Accra Economic Growth Summit was officially launched in July 2025 with the Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, as part of a campaign to strengthen economic cooperation between Ghana and the United Kingdom through meaningful diaspora engagement.</p><p>Dr. Asiama also stated that there is considerable scope to scale up remittance inflows from the UK through the implementation of well-targeted policy measures and incentive-based frameworks adding that Diaspora inflows must be harnessed beyond consumption and deliberately channeled into sustainable investment that drives long-term growth.</p><p><br></p><p>The flows, he explained, have played a vital role in supporting household consumption, strengthened balance of payments, and enhanced macroeconomic stability.</p><p><br></p><p>“However, beyond consumption, remittances hold even greater potential as a driver of productive investment. When strategically channelled, they can finance small and medium-sized enterprises expand housing, modernise agriculture and, in doing so, create sustainable employment for young people through knowledge and skills transfer programmes at the national and local levels,” he noted.</p><p><br></p><p>The Governor mentioned that the Central Bank will soon roll out many targeted interventions including the development of the National Remittance Strategy in close collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, as well as a Remittance Road show to advance inclusive, continent-wide engagement with diasporans.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am calling on all stakeholders, including development partners and our diaspora leaders – let’s work together deliberately and decisively to transform remittances from simple transfers into powerful engines of growth, resilience and shared prosperity”.</p><p>“By deepening our markets, strengthening our institutions, and mobilising diaspora capital through credible and transparent frameworks, we can build a more resilient, investment-driven future for Ghana,” he emphasised.</p><p><br></p>"

      "content": "<p>Pop culture has also changed over the years from having set characters and expected career trajectories. Public personalities do not have to ensure that they present a certain image for many years. Rather, they have to operate within a cultural setting where identity is fluid, and narratives change rapidly.</p><p>This is not a trend that is strictly limited to the world of music. Actors, musicians, media figures, and influencers are also increasingly measured by their ability to adapt to the changing expectations of their culture rather than by any single explosive moment. The process of reinvention has become less a dramatic turning point than an evolutionary one.</p><p>This audience is now more aware of the power of storytelling than ever. They instinctively recognize the power of branding, image management, and public reinvention. They see transparency, vulnerability, and self-definition as a value. Public figures are expected not only to perform but to explain how they are transforming.</p><p>This pressure has reshaped the way celebrities interact with the audience. A resume has become determined not merely by talent, but also by narrative management. A change in tone, beauty, and audience position is interpreted in various ways, depending on the particular cultural context.</p><p>The need for evolution is not solely an artistic expression. It has a lot to do with staying relevant and being relevant for a long time. In a generation where cultural change is encouraged to occur at a faster pace, staying stagnant is likely an experience in becoming obsolete.</p><p>Such transformations are often indicative of more pervasive conflicts existing between or related to identity, gender, power, and authenticity. Artists’ reinventions of themselves in the public realm are sometimes reactions to more pervasive currents than are happening in isolation among those artists themselves.</p><p>In the broader culture, occasional examples from particular individuals bring these issues to the forefront. Cases involving transformation among public figures are, in turn, seen to revive discussions related to identity among others, as found in cultural studies like https://worldfashionnews.com/lady-gaga-new-cover-story, which examine the development of public figures in tandem with audience expectations.</p><p>Reinvention happens not in a vacuum. The public plays an integral part in deciding whether or not a transformation seems authentic or PR-managed. Feedback can confirm or deny a transformation. This gives or takes: contemporary celebrity culture has become much more of a dialogue.</p><p>What is relevant now might become antiquated soon. Therefore, the key to effective re-innovation is awareness of the present moment and the cultural zeitgeist. Individuals with this quality appear to strike the right balance between continuity and change.</p><p>It is the overall trend and not the individuals themselves that are of consequence here. The shift in the pop story that is currently happening has to do with adaptability. Instead of identity being seen as a fixed and finalized concept, the notion of identity itself changes through personal experience and cultural evolution.</p><p>This has broader implications than entertainment. The manner in which public figures handle reinvention affects the discourse on self-expression, the power of resilience, and the possibilities of personal growth. Pop culture can be viewed as the grounds for the exploration of these concepts and their universal acceptance.</p><p>With the accelerating pace of media cycles and shifts in cultural expectations, reinvention will likely be an ever-present phenomenon on the public stage. The distinctions between reality and performance will further overlap, and identity will be an overriding theme within the narrative discourse. With all of this in place, pop culture not only entertains consumers; it is also a reflection of how society comprehends change in general. The type of story that is most closely followed is usually that of change as a process rather than an event.</p><p>MSport 2026: New Features, Real Winners, and Why MSport Is Africa’s Biggest Sports Betting Platform.</p><p>Understanding AI Face Swap: From Entertainment to Industry Use Cases</p>"

When he said the NPP had huge ministerial appointments, were we not the same people who told him to reduce it to 60 ministers when we win political power?</p><p><br></p><p>“We are the same people who told him to reduce the number to 60 ministers when we win political power. If you had said he should appoint 1,000 ministers at the time, he could have appointed 1,000 ministers now, which could have led to your appointments into government.</p><p>“Why didn’t you say that he should appoint 1,000 ministers when we win political power then? You didn’t say that because you knew that if he had said he will appoint 1,000 ministers, the 2024 victory wouldn’t have been possible. You knew that the 60 ministers promise would ensure our victory,” he pointed out.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Mr. Nketia, even the opposition NPP has realised that the NDC is suffering over their campaign promise of reducing the size of government, saying, “the NPP are mocking us that outside gentility, home cry. We are being hailed outside for being a good government, but our members are worried because of lack of appointments.”</p><p><br></p><p>Beaming with broad smiles even as he addressed the NDC members, Asiedu Nketia said President Mahama is fulfilling his campaign promise of reducing the size of government to protect the national purse, adding that the NDC members should stop agitating over lack of appointments and rather support the President to deliver.</p><p><br></p><p>The NDC National Chairman urged the party members not to give up hope and rather continue to work for the party to remain in government, noting that “If the government continue to perform well as it’s doing now, we shall prolong our stay in political office for other qualified members to also be appointed into government.”</p><p><br></p><p>According to him, if the NDC members continue to agitate over lack of appointments, it may eventually lead to the collapse of the government, which may send the NDC back into opposition, warning, “If we are in opposition, it’s not Bawumia or Kennedy Agyapong who will appoint you as a minister.”</p><p><br></p><p>Asiedu Nketia therefore urged the NDC members not to take their party matters into the public domain, warning that such weird acts would give the NPP ammunition to fire at the NDC, saying, “I’m pleading with you, let’s not wash our dirty linen outside. The NPP are best at mocking people. They will mock you if you continue to take our issues to the public.”</p><p><br></p>"

While the Trust maintains that the indexation is designed to preserve the purchasing power of retirees, the CSPF contends that the percentage is a “drop in the ocean” for those struggling to survive on the 2025 minimum monthly pension of GH¢396.58.</p><p><br></p><p>The Forum in their statement expressed deep concern that the 10% adjustment does not stop the slide of retirees into “abject poverty”. The group’s primary grievances include:</p><ul><li>Cost-of-Living Pressures: The rising price of essential drugs, food, and utilities outpaces the small marginal increase in monthly payouts.</li><li>Injustice for Low-Earners: The current indexation model, according to the group, does not sufficiently “cushion” those at the bottom end of the pension scale.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Failure of Consultation: The CSPF believes that a more robust engagement with retiree forums could have resulted in a “living level” minimum pension that reflects current market prices.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>The CSPF further indicated that it may take further actions, including formal petitions to the National Pensions Regulatory Authority (NPRA) and Parliament, to demand a review of the 2026 indexation rate.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

In the 49th minute, he provided a perfectly weighted pass for Rico Lewis to score City’s fifth goal, demonstrating his vision and ability to link play. \n\nJust five minutes later, he was on the scoresheet himself, calmly finishing after being set up by Ryan Cherki to register his first goal in City colours.\n\nBeyond the goal and assist, Semenyo was a constant threat, stretching Exeter’s defence with his pace, intelligent movements and direct running. His pressing and energy also impressed, helping City maintain their intensity even with a comfortable lead.\n\nAntoine Semenyo scores and assists on Manchester City debut\n\nManchester City eventually ran out 10–1 winners to book their place in the next round of the FA Cup, but it was Semenyo’s impact that stole the spotlight. \n\nHis performance earned him the Man of the Match award, a perfect way to announce his arrival and a clear signal that he is ready to play a major role in City’s quest for silverware.\n\nWatch the highlights below:</p><p>Antoine Semenyo vs Exeter\n\nMOTM on His Man City Debut.pic.twitter.com/iyh0YEgnsJ</p>"

      "content": "<p>The government’s flagship 24-hour economy policy has failed to meet expectations set during the election campaign, a legal scholar and policy analyst Ishaq Ibrahim has said, arguing that the government’s approach remains unclear one year into office.</p><p>Speaking on Asaase Radio’s The Forum on Saturday (9 January), Ibrahim, a lecturer at the UPSA Law School, said the policy as currently presented does not reflect what was promised when the governing National Democratic Congress (NDC) was in opposition.</p><p>“When it comes to the 24-hour economy, even a lame person would say the government has failed in that regard,” Ibrahim said. “They marketed it as a three-shift system, so one would have thought that the moment they got power, implementation would begin.”</p><p>Ibrahim said the lack of clarity around the policy has made it difficult to assess government performance against its manifesto commitments.</p><p>He added that the disconnect between campaign messaging and policy delivery raised concerns about whether the government itself fully understands the programme.</p><p>“What we have seen so far doesn’t even tell us what the 24-hour economy really is,” he said. “Those responsible for implementing it have presented something different, so we cannot use what was promised during the campaign to measure current performance.”</p><p>“It is like what they promised is not what they are delivering,” Ibrahim said. “And it seems they cannot understand it as well.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the John Mahama administration plans to have its 24-hour economy program fully operational by the end of 2026, the Minister of Youth Development and Empowerment, George Opare-Addo, said on Thursday.</p><p>Speaking in an interview with Kumasi-based Nhyira FM, Opare-Addo emphasised that the policy aims to transform the traditional eight-hour workday system into a continuous 24-hour economic structure, a process he said requires time and legislative support.</p><p>“Changing the entire structure of an economy that has been in place for years, from an 8-hour to a 24-hour system, cannot happen in less than 12 months. It requires legislative measures and directives, and those processes are underway,” he said.</p><p>The minister encouraged Ghanaians to anticipate the full integration of the policy later this year.</p><p>“Everyone who is honest will see that progress is being made. Changing the structure of the economy is not a one-time event; it is a process that takes time to unfold. We are clearly on track, and by the end of this year, we expect to see the full impact of the 24-hour economy,” Opare-Addo added.</p><p>The government says the initiative is intended to boost productivity, create jobs, and enhance the efficiency of public and private sector operations across the country.</p><p>Asaase Broadcasting Company airs on Asaase 99.5 Accra, Asaase 98.5 Kumasi, Asaase 99.7 Tamale, Asaase 100.3 Cape Coast, AsaasePa 107.3 (Accra).\nAffiliates: Bawku FM 101.5, Bead FM 99.9 (Bimbilla), Mining City Radio 89.5 (Tarkwa), Nandom FM 101.9, Nyatefe Radio 94.5 (Dzodze), Sissala Radio 96.3 (Tumu), Somuaa FM 89.9 (Gushegu), Stone City 90.7 (Ho) and Wale FM 106.9 (Walewale).\nListen online: asaaseradio.com, Sound Garden and TuneIn.\nFollow us:\nX: @asaaseradio995, @Asaase985ksi, @Asaase997tamale, @asaase1003, asaasepa1073\nInstagram: asaaseradio99.5, asaase985ksi, asaase100.3, asaase99.7tamale, asaasepa107.3\nLinkedIn: company/asaaseradio995. TikTok: @asaaseradio99.5\nFacebook: asaase99.5, asaase985ksi, Asaase100.3, asaase99.7, AsaasePa107.3.\nYouTube: AsaaseRadioXtra.\nJoin the conversation.

They had no plans for galamsey,” Ibrahim said. “When they were in opposition, they marketed it as an existential threat, and the moment they took power, the way they are dealing with it tells you they are not ready to solve it.”</p><p>“If the very person who is suffering has no appetite to prosecute them, why would their native country have an interest in prosecuting them?” he asked.</p><p>He also highlighted the revocation of mining rights in forest reserves as an example of the government’s limited commitment to addressing the problem, arguing that the measures taken so far indicate a lack of genuine interest in resolving illegal mining.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) has rejected claims that government efforts against illegal mining, popularly known as galamsey, have failed to match strong political rhetoric.</p><p>Matthew Kojo Njourkone, Ashanti Regional Director of Interparty Relations and CSOs for the NDC, said results on the ground reflect sustained and systematic action rather than cosmetic enforcement.</p><p>“There is no mismatch between our message and performance,” he said on the Asaase Breakfast Show on Wednesday (7 January).</p><p>According to him, the Mahama administration inherited extensive damage caused by what he described as a surge in mining licenses issued shortly before the previous government exited office.</p><p>“You cannot expect a government to clean eight years of damage in a few months,” he argued.</p><p>Asaase Broadcasting Company airs on Asaase 99.5 Accra, Asaase 98.5 Kumasi, Asaase 99.7 Tamale, Asaase 100.3 Cape Coast, AsaasePa 107.3 (Accra).\nAffiliates: Bawku FM 101.5, Bead FM 99.9 (Bimbilla), Mining City Radio 89.5 (Tarkwa), Nandom FM 101.9, Nyatefe Radio 94.5 (Dzodze), Sissala Radio 96.3 (Tumu), Somuaa FM 89.9 (Gushegu), Stone City 90.7 (Ho) and Wale FM 106.9 (Walewale).\nListen online: asaaseradio.com, Sound Garden and TuneIn.\nFollow us:\nX: @asaaseradio995, @Asaase985ksi, @Asaase997tamale, @asaase1003, asaasepa1073\nInstagram: asaaseradio99.5, asaase985ksi, asaase100.3, asaase99.7tamale, asaasepa107.3\nLinkedIn: company/asaaseradio995. TikTok: @asaaseradio99.5\nFacebook: asaase99.5, asaase985ksi, Asaase100.3, asaase99.7, AsaasePa107.3.\nYouTube: AsaaseRadioXtra.\nJoin the conversation.

      "content": "<p>Dr Jones Ofori-Atta, a distinguished Ghanaian economist, academic and politician, occupies a notable place in the country’s post-independence political and intellectual history. \n\nBest known in recent times as the father of former Minister of Finance Ken Ofori-Atta, his own public life spanned academia, Parliament and government, leaving a legacy that continues to shape national discourse decades after his active service.\n\nBorn on December 7, 1937, in the Eastern Region, Jones Ofori-Atta hailed from the influential Ofori-Atta family of Akyem Abuakwa. \n\nHe was the son of Nana Sir Ofori Atta I, the paramount chief of Akyem Abuakwa and a towering figure in Ghana’s colonial and early post-colonial political development. \n\nThis heritage placed him at the intersection of traditional authority and modern statecraft from an early age.\n\nOfori-Atta’s early education took him through some of Ghana’s most prestigious institutions, including Achimota School, before he pursued higher education at the University of Ghana. \n\nHe later earned a doctorate in economics from the University of Ottawa in Canada, establishing himself as a rigorous scholar at a time when Ghana was building its first generation of post-independence intellectuals.\n\nHe returned to Ghana to lecture at the University of Ghana, where he became known for his analytical depth and clarity in economic thought. \n\nHis academic career culminated in his appointment as Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences, a role that underscored his standing within the university and the wider policy community.\n\nJones Ofori-Atta transitioned from academia into politics during the Second Republic, winning election as Member of Parliament for Begoro in 1969 on the ticket of the Progress Party. \n\nHe was subsequently appointed Deputy Minister of Finance and Economic Planning in the government of Prime Minister Kofi Abrefa Busia.\n\nIn that role, he was involved in shaping economic policy at a critical moment in Ghana’s history, as the country grappled with balance-of-payments challenges, currency pressures and structural weaknesses inherited from earlier administrations. \n\nHis tenure coincided with difficult fiscal decisions, some of which later became the subject of public debate following the overthrow of the Busia government in 1972.\n\nFollowing years away from frontline politics, Ofori-Atta returned to Parliament in 1979 during the Third Republic as a member of the Popular Front Party. \n\nHe served as an opposition figure and finance spokesperson, earning a reputation as a sharp and articulate contributor to parliamentary debates on economic management.\n\nHe remained active within the Danquah-Busia political tradition and, in 1996, contested the presidential primaries of the New Patriotic Party, though he was unsuccessful. After withdrawing from electoral politics, he continued to offer policy advice and public commentary on national issues.\n\nBeyond Parliament, Ofori-Atta served in several state roles, including as Chairman of the Volta River Authority in the early 2000s, where he contributed to discussions on energy policy and infrastructure development.\n\nPublic debate and historical scrutiny\n\nOfori-Atta’s legacy has not been without controversy. His time at the Ministry of Finance during the Busia era has often been revisited by critics and analysts assessing the economic challenges that preceded the 1972 military coup. \n\nIn later years, these debates resurfaced in the public arena, particularly during the tenure of his son as finance minister, reflecting how historical memory continues to shape Ghana’s political conversations.\n\nSupporters, however, argue that his policy positions must be understood within the constraints of the era and credit him for intellectual honesty and commitment to democratic governance during a turbulent period.\n\nDeath and enduring legacy\n\nJones Ofori-Atta passed away on November 30, 2020, at the age of 86. Tributes following his death described him as a scholar-politician who combined academic discipline with public service, and as a mentor to many economists and policymakers.\n\nJones Ofori-Atta was father to four children – Ken Ofori-Atta, former Minister of Finance; Duke Ofori-Atta, Earl Ofori-Atta and Nana Yaa Ofori-Atta. He was predeceased by his first wife, Maud, and is survived by his widow, Ellen, and grandchildren.\n\nHe was the son of Okyenhene Yere Maame Duodua and Nana Sir Ofori-Atta, brother of Grace Amoakwaa Ofori-Atta, Ghana’s first female national librarian.\n\nHis father was the longest-serving African member of the Legislative Assembly (the Parliament of the Gold Coast). Nana Sir Ofori-Atta, the first traditional ruler to establish a stool fund, from which he founded schools and infrastructure in Okyeman, famously had 44 wives.\n\nConsequently, Okyenheneba had over 100 siblings. Among them were William “Paa Willie” Ofori-Atta, a member of the Big Six and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Education, Youth and Sports in the Second Republic, Eugene Aaron Ofori-Atta (Speaker of Parliament in the First Republic) and Kwasi Amoako-Atta (finance minister in the First Republic).\n\nHe was also the brother of Eugene Ofori-Atta, who served as Ghana’s high commissioner to Uganda; Adeline Akufo-Addo, First Lady in the Second Republic; Dr Susan DeGraft Johnson, the first female doctor in the Gold Coast; A A Ampofo, who served as administrator of the Upper Region; the trade unionist Yaw Guggisberg Asante; Ofori Panin Ofori-Atta (Beyeeman); and Alexander Ofori-Atta, father of the current Okyenhene, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin.\n\nToday, Jones Ofori-Atta is remembered as part of a generation that sought to define Ghana’s economic and political identity in the decades after independence — a man whose ideas, decisions and lineage continue to resonate within the country’s national story.\n\nAE</p>"

A little while later he was appointed a minister in his country. Meanwhile I had completed my tenure as Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and taken up a professorial appointment in a US university. I tried to reach him by phone on a professional matter but he did not pick my call. \n\n“He did not respond to messages I sent. I was disappointed, but I also heard similar complaints from other mutual friends and acquaintances. Few could \"recognize\" our friend's character and conduct anymore.\n\n“A few years later his party lost the elections in his country and he was out of government. He came under investigation on allegations of corruption. His country reportedly sought to extradite him from a foreign country where he had apparently taken refuge. \n\n“Recent reports are that his has now been arrested in that country on immigration charges.

An expiration is a passive end to a travel document; a revocation is an active cancellation, often triggered by a request from a foreign government or the discovery of disqualifying factors.</p><p>“In June 2025, his visa was revoked; it’s not an expiration of the visa. The information we have is that his visa was revoked. So he has been living in America without a visa,” the Deputy A-G explained.</p><p>He further noted that ICE’s intervention was the logical conclusion of this status: “ICE will not come for you unless you have visa issues; that is what has happened.”</p><p>“We are keenly involved in this matter. We collaborate with law enforcement agencies in this matter,” Dr Srem-Sai affirmed.</p><p>Mr Ofori-Atta’s anticipated return comes at a time when the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) and the Attorney-General are preparing to prosecute high-profile cases involving the Strategic Mobilisation Limited (SML) deal and the controversial National Cathedral project.</p><p>The former minister had been in the U.S. seeking medical treatment, but his legal team—Menka-Premo, Osei-Bonsu, Bruce-Cathline and Partners—now faces the daunting task of preventing his immediate removal.</p><p>While they argue that a \"pending petition for adjustment of status\" should protect him, Dr Srem-Sai’s revelations about a pre-existing revocation suggest that the U.S. government may have already decided on his status.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Prof Kingsley Moghalu, has shared a reflective account on the corrupting influence of power, a commentary that has drawn attention amid the ongoing controversy surrounding Ghana’s former Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, who is currently in detention in the United States.\n\nIn a post published on LinkedIn on January 10, 2026, Prof Moghalu recounted a personal experience involving an unnamed African friend who, after attending his 50th birthday in Abuja, was later appointed a minister in his home country.\n\nAccording to Moghalu, after the friend assumed office, repeated attempts to reach him on a professional matter were ignored, with calls unanswered and messages left unreplied. \n\nHe noted that similar complaints were raised by other mutual friends, many of whom felt the individual’s character had changed after gaining power.\n\nSources say Ofori-Atta living normally, not outwardly very sick - Manasseh claims\n\n“An African friend attended my 50th birthday in Abuja from his country. A little while later he was appointed a minister in his country. Meanwhile I had completed my tenure as Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and taken up a professorial appointment in a US university. I tried to reach him by phone on a professional matter but he did not pick my call. \n\n“He did not respond to messages I sent. I was disappointed, but I also heard similar complaints from other mutual friends and acquaintances. Few could \"recognize\" our friend's character and conduct anymore.\n\n“A few years later his party lost the elections in his country and he was out of government. He came under investigation on allegations of corruption. His country reportedly sought to extradite him from a foreign country where he had apparently taken refuge. \n\n“Recent reports are that his has now been arrested in that country on immigration charges. Charges or indictments, of course, do not automatically mean guilt unless and until established by the courts. But, lesson: vanity of vanities, all is vanity, “his post read. \n\nMeanwhile, the Embassy of Ghana in Washington, DC, has confirmed that Ken Ofori-Atta has been taken into custody by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nIn a press release issued on Friday, January 10, 2026, and signed by Ghana’s Ambassador to the United States, Victor Emmanuel Smith, the Embassy said it received information about the detention and immediately took steps to verify the circumstances surrounding the matter.\n\nFollowing confirmation, the Embassy formally contacted the detention facility to request access to Ofori-Atta in order to offer consular assistance in accordance with diplomatic and international protocols.\n\nHowever, officials at the facility informed the Embassy that Ofori-Atta declined to engage with consular officers at that time, indicating he would only do so in the presence of his lawyers.\n\nThe Embassy said it remains in contact with relevant United States authorities and will continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that Ofori-Atta’s rights are fully respected.\n\nIn Ghana, Ofori-Atta has been charged with corruption and corruption-related offences in connection with the Strategic Mobilisation Limited (SML) scandal. The Government of Ghana has formally requested his extradition from the United States to face the charges.\n\nInvestigative journalist Manasseh Azure Awuni has quoted a source close to Ofori-Atta as saying that as of July 2025, the former finance minister had no intention of returning to Ghana, citing fears of humiliation by the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP).\n\nOfori-Atta’s lawyers have maintained that his arrest and detention by ICE are related to “the status of his current stay in the United States.”\n\nHowever, Attorney General Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine has disclosed that Ofori-Atta’s US visa was revoked in July 2025, and that the US Department of State granted him until November 29, 2025, to leave the country.\n\nKen Ofori-Atta is expected to appear before a United States court on January 20, 2026, in relation to his current arrest.\n\n\n\nAM\n\nAlso, watch below Amnesty International's 'Protect the Protest' documentary as the world marks International Human Rights Day 2025</p>"

He brings something to the front line that we really need,\" Lijnders stated during the post-match briefing. \"He can attack quickly, wants to chase, and is a guy who doesn't stop. You see today that he can adapt quite quickly to our style.\"</p><p>Lijnders highlighted that Semenyo’s willingness to chase and press from the front is exactly the high-intensity profile the club sought when they triggered his release clause earlier this month.</p><p>The 10-1 scoreline serves as a terrifying warning to the rest of English football as Manchester City advances to the next round of the FA Cup. For Semenyo, the \"dream start\" provides the perfect platform as the club’s attention pivots toward silverware.</p><p>The Black Stars forward is now expected to be a central figure in City’s upcoming Carabao Cup semi-final showdown against Newcastle United.</p><p>If his debut performance is any indication, the St. James' Park faithful will have a significant task on their hands to contain City's newest attacking weapon.</p>"

Edgar Brian Torres Tovar of Des Moines, Iowa, and 29-year-old Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard of Marshalltown, Iowa. Both were members of the Iowa National Guard, which began deploying roughly 1,800 troops to the Middle East earlier this year as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the US mission to defeat ISIS. Three other Iowa National Guard members were injured in the attack.\n\nA US official told CNN that Saturday’s operation fired over 90 precision munitions to hit more than 35 targets, using over two dozen aircraft.\n\n“Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,” US Central Command said in the release.\n\nHundreds of American troops continue to be deployed to Syria as part of the US’ longstanding mission to combat ISIS, a mission that began when ISIS rapidly took control of a large chunk of Syria and Iraq in the mid 2010s. Subsequently, US and partner operations, paired with a change in regime in Syria, largely eliminated that territorial control.\n\nCNN has previously reported that the goal of Operation Hawkeye is to deliver a big blow to ISIS remnants in Syria and their ability to pose a threat to US forces in the region.</p>"

It feels like a seamless transition into the team.</p><p>\"He's a really good person as well which is another positive.\"</p><p>Having scored 10 Premier League goals this season for Bournemouth, Semenyo's first for City saw him run on to Rayan Cherki's pass and slipping a finish under Exeter goalkeeper Joe Whitworth.</p><p>In turn, he became the first player to both score and assist a goal on his City debut since Sergio Aguero against Swansea in August 2011.</p><p>That is some player to emulate, given the Argentine striker went on to become City's record goalscorer during a decade with them, lifting five Premier League titles, six League Cups and an FA Cup triumph in 2019.</p><p>Semenyo has started in perfect fashion as victory over Exeter made it 12 unbeaten games in all competitions for City as they continue to fight on all fronts.</p><p>Three consecutive Premier League draws has left them six points behind leaders Arsenal, while their next game is the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final at Newcastle on Tuesday.</p><p>Lijnders said: \"The last three games we wanted, of course, we created the chances to score more goals and to win the game. That would have already created a different position in the league.</p><p>\"But overall, I think we have a really special group. The amount of experienced players who take lead of the team, the way they guide all the others, the way new players are settling in and the energy. I'm not only talking about the games, but especially training. In the training centre it's special and we are on our way.</p><p>\"We now play the semi-final for the League Cup, we go further here in the FA Cup and we are in a good position in the Champions League. We want to build on that.\"</p><p>'My players were excited for two or three minutes'</p><p>The scoreline ticked to 9-0 on 86 minutes when impressive debutant Ryan McAidoo drilled in and the 17-year-old's finish was greeted with chants of \"we want 10\" from the home supporters.</p><p>Although 19-year-old George Birch pulled a stunning goal back for the Grecians, Lewis smashed home as City became the first top-flight side to score 10 or more goals in any English competition since Liverpool beat Fulham 10-0 in the League Cup in September 1986.</p><p>Exeter boss Gary Caldwell, who was part of the Wigan Athletic squad that upset City in the 2013 FA Cup final, said: \"When the team sheet came in, it was an experience we didn't envisage.</p><p>\"I think my players were excited for two or three minutes, but then they got on the pitch and realised he [Haaland] is the best number nine in the world.</p><p>\"It's a lesson that when one of the best managers of all time needs to win a game he picks a team to win it.

The U.S. authorities helped us to arrest this person.”</p><p>Although the Deputy Attorney-General did not disclose the identity of the individual, the timing and location of the arrest have sparked intense speculation in legal and political circles. The arrest marks a \"proof of concept\" for the ministry’s new stance, which is that escaping Ghana’s borders no longer equates to escaping its laws.</p><p>Dr. Srem-Sai’s comments were designed to dispel the notion that fugitives can hide behind the years of litigation often associated with extradition treaties.</p><p>He explained that the state is now drawing a \"clear line\" between formal extradition and other administrative or immigration-based pathways that can result in the same outcome: the surrender of a suspect.</p><p>“Extradition is not the only way that a person will be removed from one country and surrendered to another country,” he stated. “We need to draw two lines here. The formal one is the extradition process, and there are other lawful ways of getting a fugitive to come back.”</p><p>The Deputy Attorney-General used the platform to issue a warning to other officials and individuals currently residing abroad to avoid prosecution.</p><p>He emphasised that the government's commitment to accountability is absolute and that no resource is being spared in the pursuit of those who have fled.</p><p>“We have been doing our best to ensure that anyone who has run away from accountability is brought back,” he reiterated.</p><p>The revelation comes at a sensitive time, as the state is also navigating the high-profile detention of former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p><p>Dr. Srem-Sai’s insistence on \"multiple legal pathways\" suggests that the government is prepared to use every administrative tool at its disposal—from visa revocations to deportation orders—to ensure that foreign soil remains a hostile environment for those evading Ghanaian justice.</p>"

Biney at Peduase, Aburi. \n\nThe assailants made away with several valuables, including iPhones 12 Pro, iPhone 16 Plus, an Infinix Hot 50i, assorted jewellery and an unspecified amount of cash.\n\nFollowing intelligence-led investigations, personnel of the Eastern Regional Police Intelligence Department (PID), in collaboration with the Accra Regional PID, arrested Kofi Ishmael, aged 30, on 6 January 2026 at his hideout at Avenor in Accra.\n\nThe police in a statement explained that during interrogation, Kofi Ishmael confessed to his role in the Peduase robbery and identified Kwame Bediako, popularly known by several aliases including Star Boy, Nkokopo, Kwame Mike, and Father, as the ringleader of the gang. \n\nGH¢7.5m Adabraka Jewellery Shop Robbery: Police arrest two more suspects\n\nHe also named other accomplices, including Kwasi Akambuley (Kwasi Fresh), Salia Mohammed (Kwaku Nuah), Mumuni Abdul Razak Akakuub (Mogambo), Aticho Kojo (Kalovi) and Kwame Bonsu (Killer Ntua).\n\nActing on information provided by Kofi Ishmael, police arrested Kwame Bediako at his hideout at Ablekumah, Agape. A search conducted at the residence uncovered a pump-action gun buried in the fence wall, concealed in a sack together with four BB cartridges.\n\nAccording to the police, Kwame Bediako admitted his involvement in the Peduase robbery and further mentioned Gideon, a taxi driver, as another accomplice.\n\nFurther investigations revealed that the gang was behind several highway robberies targeting Burkinabe, Nigerian, Malian and Ghanaian trailer drivers along major routes, including the Tema Motorway, Achimota Forest Road, Pokuase, Amasaman, Suhum, Nkawkaw and the Juaso–Kumasi stretch.\n\nKwame Bediako disclosed that the gang was planning to carry out another robbery on the very day he was arrested.\n\nSuspects Kwame Bediako and Kofi Ishmael later led police to Nkawkaw, Fodoa and Nnadieso in the Eastern Region, where several accomplices Kwasi Akambuley, Salia Mohammed, Mumuni Abdul Razak Akakuub, Aticho Kojo and Kwame Bonsu were arrested while allegedly preparing to engage in another highway robbery.\n\nOther suspects mentioned include Michael Antwi (Yaw Prince), currently on remand at Juaso; Stephen Amoako, on remand at Weija and others identified as Mawugah, JJC, Osei, Baker and Kooko, who are currently at large.

He questioned the government’s narrative of economic stability in the face of environmental collapse.\n\n” The government claims it has made so much money and that the cedi is stable, but the question is: what is happening to our environment? There is ongoing devastation. Galamsey activities have increased—it is even happening within some schools and yet these are not the issues being prioritized,” Shaib stated.\n\n​He further accused the government of accepting “blood money,” arguing that the nation’s financial gains are built on the back of a crisis that is killing citizens and destroying water bodies.\n​\n​The Deputy Minority Whip dismissed the government’s claims of economic achievement as “pure propaganda” and “dangerous experiments,” noting that any alleged gains are not reflected in the lives of ordinary Ghanaians.\n\n​He also took aim at the government’s flagship 24-hour economy proposal, accusing the administration of failing to move past the rhetoric.\n\nAhmed Shaib noted that despite the “noise” surrounding the policy, the government is only now considering a paper for review and planning to establish a new Authority.\n\nHe alleged that those who should be holding the government accountable have “gone to sleep” because they are either working with or being supported by the administration.\n\nThe lawmaker ​stressed with a grim assessment of the country’s direction, citing a recent helicopter crash as a missed opportunity for the government to take a stand against galamsey.\n\nHe argued the tragedy should have served as a turning point to end galamsey in honor of the victims. Instead, he claimed, the government continues to chase “blood money” to manage the country’s affairs.\n\n​”If we don’t talk about these things, our nation is under siege,” he warned. “People are dying and contracting diseases because of the manner in which our water bodies are being messed up.”</p>"

      "content": "<p>Investigative journalist Manasseh Azure Awuni has revealed that Ghana’s former Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, appears to be living a normal life in Washington, DC.\n\nAccording to him, his sources indicate that Ofori-Atta does not outwardly show signs of being gravely ill, contrary to claims that his health condition prevents him from facing legal proceedings.\n\nAG drops details of confidential conversation he had with 'top' US lawyers of Ofori-Atta\n\nSpeaking on TV3 on January 10, 2026, Manasseh cautioned that health matters are sensitive but insisted that observations from people who see Ofori-Atta regularly suggest he is not severely incapacitated.\n\n“When it comes to health, you cannot say much, but according to these sources, they see him [Ofori-Atta] living normally. That is what the sources say. Sometimes you see him out, and sometimes he gets visitors. So it's like that’s the outward appearance. That's what these sources say,” he stated.\n\nManasseh, however, acknowledged that appearances alone cannot conclusively determine a person’s medical condition.\n\n“But of course, this is a health issue; you cannot just see someone and assume everyone is right,” he noted.\n\nHe noted that if claims by Ofori-Atta’s lawyers about his recuperation are accurate, then reports of his public activity would align with that position.\n\n“But if they say he's recuperating, I suspect he's getting better, as the lawyers may have said, because from people who see him, that's from the outside, it doesn't look like someone who is very sick,” he said.\n\nThe investigative journalist further indicated that the information from Washington, DC, corroborates earlier reports that placed the former finance minister in the US capital late last year.\n\nManasseh also referenced Ofori-Atta’s travel history, which confirms his presence in the United States.\n\n“And I think this information we are getting from Washington DC is consistent with somewhere last year, December or so, there were some reports that he was some reports that he was cited in Washington DC,” he stated.\n\nAG Ayine confirms Ofori-Atta arrest was due to extradition request\n\nHe added, “And if you look at his travel records, he left this country on January 4, 2025, departed from Terminal 3, and then the airline he boarded was the United Airlines flight 997. That airline was headed for Washington DC, so it looks like his location and life within the DC area have also been confirmed.”</p><p>ICE Detains Ofori-Atta: Investigative journalist Manasseh Azure Awuni claims that sources observing Ken Ofori-Atta say the former finance minister is living normally and does not appear to be gravely ill.#TheKeyPoints #TV3GH pic.twitter.com/vSY56Kh4IT</p>"

      "content": "<p>Non-league Macclesfield produced the greatest shock in FA Cup history with a stunning and memorable performance to knock out holders Crystal Palace.\n\nThe hosts are ranked 117 places below Premier League side Palace, meaning this was the biggest upset in the competition of all time in terms of league places, but on the pitch, that gap was non-existent as this was a deserved win for Macclesfield.\n\nPaul Dawson's brilliant header in the first half had the home fans in dreamland, before Isaac Buckley-Ricketts shocked Palace further when he prodded in a second after the break.\n\nYeremy Pino set up a nervous finish for the hosts when he fired home a free-kick in stoppage time, but Macclesfield held on to secure the famous win.\n\nPalace, who had caused their own shock by beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup last May, had dominated possession from the outset but struggled to create many meaningful chances as their poor form continued.\n\nThey are now without a win in nine games, but this is by far their most disappointing result in that run.\n\nThey had fielded a mixture of young players and experienced first-teamers for this game, and the youngest player on the pitch perhaps should have given them the lead in the first half.\n\nJoel Drakes-Thomas, 16, was picked out by a brilliant cross from Kaden Rodney but just failed to connect with his head after peeling away from the defence.\n\nChristantus Uche sent a thumping strike just over the bar, but then came the moment that Macclesfield fans will cherish forever.\n\nLuke Duffy sent a great ball into the box, and Macclesfield captain Dawson rose highest to send a great header into the far corner.\n\nOliver Glasner sent on experienced Premier League players Tyrick Mitchell, Johnson, and Will Hughes for the start of the second half, but Palace appeared rattled and continued to struggle against their National League North opponents.\n\nInstead, Macclesfield continued to play with a determination and belief that they could upset Palace, and so it proved as Buckley-Ricketts reacted superbly to a deflected shot that fell into his path to flick home a second.\n\nPino's fine free-kick, curled expertly over the wall and just under the bar, gave Palace some hope of rescuing the situation, but the home side stood strong to win.\n\nMacclesfield deliver after overcoming difficult times\n\nThe final whistle prompted scenes of jubilation as fans raced onto the pitch to celebrate, with captain Dawson lofted into the air.\n\nThere have only been nine non-league wins against top-flight opponents in the past 100 years of the FA Cup.\n\nThis one was particularly significant given what Macclesfield supporters have gone through in recent times.\n\nOne hundred and forty-six years of history were consigned to the history books when Macclesfield Town ceased trading in 2020.\n\nLocal businessman Robert Smethurst bought the club's assets and, with former player Robbie Savage joining the board, they were reformed as a phoenix club.\n\nAfter joining the ninth-tier North West Counties Premier Division, three promotions in four seasons have lifted them to the sixth tier, where they are just a handful of points outside the play-off places despite being in the bottom half of the table.\n\nWith Savage having left to join Forest Green Rovers, they are now managed by John Rooney, younger brother of former England captain Wayne, and he has fashioned a side that plays with confidence and purpose, no matter who they face.\n\nThat was evident in this game, with the performance from the players all the more impressive because of the tragedy they had to deal with recently.\n\nOn 16 December, Silkmen forward Ethan McLeod died in a car accident while travelling back from Macclesfield's National League North match at Bedford Town.\n\nHis team-mates clearly wanted to pay tribute, and did so by delivering this historic result that will be talked about for years to come.\n\nPalace's poor form continues\n\nAfter celebrating their memorable FA Cup trophy win at the end of last season, Palace fans would never have envisaged their defence would end at the first stage, particularly at the hands of a team five divisions below them.\n\nGlasner certainly took a risk with his youthful starting XI, but they still possessed enough Premier League experience in the team and on the bench to have overcome this hurdle.\n\nBut aside from having plenty of possession, they looked a side completely out of sorts, with the fact that Macclesfield finished the game with more shots than them highlighting that this was a deserved result.\n\nThe opener came from a set-piece - a Palace weakness this season, as 13 of the 23 goals scored against them in the Premier League have come from such situations.\n\nPalace appeared to lack leadership on the pitch to deal with the situation, and though they came alive after Pino's strike, it ultimately came far too late.\n\nIt is an embarrassing result for Palace, but Glasner's wider focus will be on trying to turn around their alarming drop in form, with the Eagles having not won in any competition since 11 December.</p>"

Dogbevi, and dated January 10, 2026, WAES welcomed reports attributed to President John Dramani Mahama indicating that officers involved in the incident had been interdicted. However, the media advocacy body described the announcement as inadequate and falling short of democratic standards of transparency.</p><p>The incident in question occurred on Monday, January 5, 2026, at the Kasoa New Market in the Central Region, where a video widely circulated on social media showed a group of officers believed to be from the Ghana National Fire Service physically assaulting the journalist while he was covering a fire outbreak.</p><p>While acknowledging that the interdiction of the officers was a positive first step, WAES stressed that the public deserves more detailed information, including the identities and number of officers interdicted.</p><p>“The information as provided is insufficient and does not meet the standards of transparency required in a democratic system of governance and accountability,” the statement said.</p><p>WAES further raised concerns over what it described as contradictory explanations from the Public Relations Officer of the Ghana National Fire Service. According to the Editors Society, the PRO initially claimed that the journalist was not assaulted but merely had his mobile phone seized for recording an altercation without permission. In another instance, the PRO reportedly stated that the alleged assailants were not members of the Fire Service.</p><p>“These inconsistencies make it even more necessary to clearly state who the interdicted officers are and how many of them are involved,” WAES noted, adding that the public has a right to know.</p><p>The Editors Society also pointed out that the journalist has reported being assaulted by more than ten officers, making it imperative for authorities to clarify whether the interdictions correspond to the number of alleged assailants.</p><p>WAES warned that failure to handle the matter openly could encourage a culture of impunity, particularly within state security and emergency services.</p><p>“It is our considered view that impunity thrives and grows in darkness,” the statement said, stressing that transparent handling of the case would enhance accountability and help safeguard journalists in Ghana.</p><p>The Society reiterated its commitment to press freedom and urged state institutions to act decisively and openly to ensure the safety of journalists and uphold democratic values.</p><p>For more news, join The Chronicle Newspaper channel on WhatsApp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VbBSs55E50UqNPvSOm2z</p>"

      "content": "<p>Not long ago, swapping faces in a video felt like a novelty—something you’d see in viral clips or playful social media filters. Today, AI face swap technology has matured into a sophisticated system with real-world applications across entertainment, marketing, education, and even enterprise training. What began as a curiosity is now a serious tool, powered by deep learning models capable of producing surprisingly realistic results.</p><p>At the center of this shift is the video face swap—a technique that allows one person’s facial features to be mapped onto another’s movements in motion. When done well, a face swap video no longer looks artificial or gimmicky. It feels natural, expressive, and increasingly hard to distinguish from original footage. Understanding how this technology works, and where it’s being used, reveals why it’s becoming such a powerful part of modern digital workflows.</p><p>How AI Face Swap Technology Actually Works</p><p>Behind every convincing AI face swap is a combination of computer vision, neural networks, and massive datasets. At a high level, the system first detects and tracks facial landmarks—eyes, nose, mouth, jawline—frame by frame. These landmarks are then analyzed in relation to lighting, angles, and expressions.</p><p>Deep learning models, often trained on thousands of facial images, learn how a face behaves in motion. This allows the software to reconstruct a new face that mirrors the target’s expressions while preserving realism. In video face swap applications, temporal consistency is critical. The face must remain stable across frames, avoiding flickers or distortions that break immersion.</p><p>What separates modern AI face swap tools from earlier attempts is adaptability. Advanced models adjust for head movement, shadows, and emotional cues in real time. This is why today’s face swap video outputs feel less like visual tricks and more like authentic performances.</p><p>Entertainment: Where AI Face Swap Found Its First Audience</p><p>Entertainment was the natural starting point for AI face swap adoption. Film studios, content creators, and social platforms quickly realized the creative potential. In movies and TV, face swap technology has been used to de-age actors, recreate historical figures, or complete scenes when reshoots aren’t possible.</p><p>On the consumer side, short-form video platforms turned face swapping into a cultural phenomenon. Users could insert themselves into famous movie scenes or swap faces with celebrities, all within seconds. These playful applications helped normalize the technology and pushed developers to improve quality and speed.</p><p>More importantly, entertainment use cases established trust in the technology’s capabilities. When audiences saw convincing results at scale, industries beyond media started paying attention.</p><p>Marketing and Advertising: Personalization at Scale</p><p>Marketing teams are increasingly experimenting with video face swap solutions to create personalized content without reshooting campaigns. Instead of producing dozens of versions of the same advertisement, brands can now adapt a single video to different demographics or regions.</p><p>Imagine a product demo where the presenter’s face subtly changes to reflect local audiences, while the core message stays intact. This kind of localization improves engagement without ballooning production costs. AI face swap tools make this possible by preserving tone, body language, and timing.</p><p>There’s also growing interest in influencer marketing, where brands can collaborate more flexibly. While ethical boundaries must be respected, controlled and consent-based face swap video techniques allow creators to appear in multiple campaigns simultaneously, reducing scheduling constraints.</p><p>Education and Training: Learning Through Familiar Faces</p><p>One of the more understated but impactful uses of AI face swap technology is in education. Training videos often struggle with engagement, especially in corporate or compliance-heavy environments. Familiarity helps—and seeing a known instructor or internal leader can make content feel more relevant.</p><p>By applying video face swap methods, organizations can update or localize training materials without re-recording entire sessions. A single expert lecture can be adapted for different departments, languages, or regions, all while maintaining a consistent teaching style.</p><p>In medical and technical training, this approach also allows simulations where learners observe procedures demonstrated by recognizable mentors. The result is a more immersive learning experience without the logistical challenges of repeated filming.</p><p>Gaming and Virtual Characters: Identity in Motion</p><p>The gaming industry has embraced AI face swap as a way to deepen player immersion. Custom avatars are no longer static models; they’re expressive characters that can mirror a player’s facial movements in real time. This creates a stronger emotional connection between user and character.</p><p>Face swap video technology is also being used in virtual worlds and metaverse-style environments. Players can map their own faces onto digital characters, blending physical identity with virtual presence. As social interaction in digital spaces grows, this kind of personalization becomes more than cosmetic—it’s foundational.</p><p>Developers are now focusing on making these systems lightweight and privacy-conscious, ensuring performance without compromising user trust.</p><p>Ethical Considerations and Responsible Use</p><p>As AI face swap tools become more powerful, ethical responsibility becomes unavoidable. Misuse—such as non-consensual deepfake videos—has rightly raised concerns. This is why reputable platforms are implementing safeguards like watermarking, consent verification, and restricted use policies.</p><p>Responsible use starts with transparency. Viewers should know when a face swap video has been altered, especially in news, education, or political contexts. Many industry leaders are advocating for clearer labeling standards and stronger digital literacy.</p><p>From a technical perspective, developers are also exploring detection models that can identify manipulated content. This balance between innovation and accountability will shape how widely AI face swap technology is accepted in the years ahead.</p><p>Platforms Powering the Next Generation of Face Swap Tools</p><p>As demand grows, platforms offering accessible, high-quality AI face swap services are gaining traction. PixNova AI is a cutting-edge platform offering a range of innovative online image generation, editing, and interactive services. These include AI-powered face-swapping, image creation, one-click outfit changes, AI virtual character interactions, and more. Tools like this lower the barrier to entry while maintaining professional-grade output.</p><p>What sets modern platforms apart is usability. Users no longer need technical expertise to create polished results. Cloud-based processing, intuitive interfaces, and fast rendering have turned video face swap from a specialist task into a mainstream capability.</p><p>Where AI Face Swap Is Headed Next</p><p>The future of AI face swap lies in refinement rather than spectacle. Improvements in realism, emotion tracking, and cross-cultural facial modeling will make outputs even more convincing. At the same time, regulation and ethical frameworks will mature alongside the technology.</p><p>We’re also likely to see deeper integration with real-time communication tools—video conferencing, virtual events, and interactive storytelling. As AI models become lighter and faster, face swap video features could run seamlessly on everyday devices.</p><p>Ultimately, AI face swap is no longer just about changing faces. It’s about expanding how humans express identity, tell stories, and communicate across digital spaces. Used thoughtfully, it has the potential to enhance creativity and efficiency across industries—without losing sight of trust and authenticity.</p><p>Video Face Swap Explained: How AI Is Changing Digital Identity</p>"

He was quickly fouled by Paul Kwame and the resultant free kick was wasted.</p><p>Before Saturday's match, Hearts of Oak were the least scoring team in the league with 11 goals in 17 matches, and their poor form in front of goal continued as they failed to sustain attacks.</p><p>Their hosts, who fired head coach Abdul Rahim Bashiru Tijani in midweek, grew into the game, midway through the first half, but were ultimately indecisive in front of goal.</p><p>Half an hour into the game, Guinean import Yoroba Bangoura found himself in space on a counter break, but his pass to Kwadwo Boamah was over hit.</p><p>The hosts threatened again when Prince Amevor found Sena Ati on the edge of the area, but his final delivery was poor.</p><p>That was the closest either side got to scoring, with both sides tightening up as the first half ended goalles.</p><p>Two minutes after the break, Hohoe United captain Safianu Usman, spurned a golden opportunity when his effort from six yards flashed wide.</p><p>Hohoe United had lost three and drawn once in their four previous matches, and it was not hard to see why.</p><p>They struggled to keep their compure, often rushing their decisions or making the wrong choice altogether despite getting into several decent positions.</p><p>In the 70th minute, a Solomon Adomako slip presented Hearts with a golden opportunity to score, but Hamza Issah's indecisiveness allowed Paul Kwame to clear the ball before he could pull the trigger.</p><p>Hearts were almost punished immediately when Benjamin Asare was called into action, producing a fine stop to save Usman's goal-bound shot after pouncing on a loose ball in the box.</p><p>Twelve minutes later, substitute Martin Karikari became the latest to miss when he shot tamely at Hohoe United goalkeeper, Kwaku Musah.</p><p>On the cusp of full time, substitute Mawuli Wayo rifled home after controlling the ball calmly in the penalty area.</p><p>The goal was met with wild jubilations by the travelling fans.</p><p>Hearts have now moved to third place with 31 points from 18 matches, while Hohoe United remain second from bottom with 18 points.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Video face swap technology has moved far beyond novelty filters and viral social media clips. What once looked like a clever trick is now a sophisticated application of artificial intelligence that is reshaping how people present themselves online. As AI face swap tools become faster, more accurate, and more accessible, they are quietly redefining the idea of digital identity—who we appear to be on screen, how we control that image, and where the boundaries now lie.</p><p>This shift is not theoretical anymore. Video face swap is already being used in content creation, marketing, entertainment, education, and even virtual communication. To understand why this matters, it helps to look closely at how the technology works, why it has advanced so quickly, and what platforms like PixNova AI are contributing to this transformation.</p><p>What Video Face Swap Really Is (Beyond the Hype)</p><p>At its core, video face swap is the process of replacing one person’s face in a video with another while preserving natural expressions, head movement, lighting, and emotional cues. Unlike early face filters that simply overlaid a static mask, modern AI face swap systems analyze facial structure, micro-expressions, and motion patterns frame by frame.</p><p>This realism is what makes the technology powerful—and controversial. The goal is no longer to create something obviously artificial, but to generate a seamless result that looks native to the original footage. When done well, the swapped face moves, reacts, and emotes in a way that feels human, not synthetic.</p><p>The technology relies heavily on deep learning models trained on large datasets of facial images and videos. These models learn how faces behave under different angles, lighting conditions, and emotional states. Once trained, they can map one identity onto another with surprising accuracy.</p><p>How AI Face Swap Technology Works in Practice</p><p>While the underlying math is complex, the workflow behind AI face swap can be understood in a few key stages.</p><p>First, the system detects and tracks faces throughout a video. This involves identifying landmarks such as eyes, nose, mouth, jawline, and facial contours. The tracking must be precise, even during fast movement or partial occlusion.</p><p>Next comes facial mapping. The AI creates a digital representation of the source face and aligns it with the target face in the video. This is where modern systems outperform older ones—adjusting for scale, angle, and expression in real time rather than applying a one-size-fits-all overlay.</p><p>Finally, the model blends the swapped face into the original footage. Skin tone matching, shadow alignment, texture smoothing, and subtle imperfections all play a role here. The best results don’t aim for perfection; they aim for believability.</p><p>Platforms like PixNova AI focus on making this process accessible without exposing users to technical complexity, allowing creators to achieve high-quality results without advanced editing skills.</p><p>Digital Identity in the Age of Video Face Swap</p><p>Digital identity used to be relatively straightforward. Your face on camera was your face. Video face swap challenges that assumption.</p><p>Today, people can present different versions of themselves depending on context. A creator might use face swap for storytelling, parody, or character-based content. A brand might localize video campaigns by swapping spokesperson faces for different regions without reshooting footage. Educators and trainers can create engaging simulations using virtual personas.</p><p>This flexibility changes how identity functions online. It becomes more modular, more intentional, and in some cases, more strategic. Rather than being a fixed representation, identity becomes something that can be adapted while still conveying emotion and authenticity.</p><p>That said, this shift also raises questions. If faces can be swapped convincingly, how do we establish trust? The answer lies not in rejecting the technology, but in using it transparently and responsibly.</p><p>Where Video Face Swap Is Being Used Today</p><p>The most visible use of video face swap remains entertainment and social content, but its real impact is happening across quieter, professional domains.</p><p>In marketing, AI face swap allows brands to personalize video messages at scale. Instead of recording dozens of variations, teams can adapt visuals efficiently while maintaining consistency. This is especially valuable for global campaigns.</p><p>In creative industries, filmmakers and editors use face swap to experiment with casting, restore archival footage, or enhance visual storytelling without reshoots. When used ethically, it opens creative doors that were previously locked by budget or logistics.</p><p>Education and training have also begun to adopt the technology. Instructors can create interactive simulations using virtual characters, making complex or sensitive scenarios easier to explore in a controlled environment.</p><p>These use cases show that video face swap is less about deception and more about creative flexibility—when applied with intent.</p><p>PixNova AI and the Shift Toward Accessible AI Tools</p><p>A major reason video face swap is becoming mainstream is accessibility. Advanced AI tools are no longer limited to research labs or high-end studios.</p><p>PixNova AI is a cutting-edge platform offering a range of innovative online image generation, editing, and interactive services. These include AI-powered face-swapping, image creation, one-click outfit changes, AI virtual character interactions, and more. By focusing on usability and output quality, platforms like this lower the barrier for creators and professionals alike.</p><p>Instead of wrestling with complex software, users can focus on outcomes—storytelling, communication, and visual impact. This shift from technical mastery to creative intent mirrors what happened with photography and video editing tools over the past decade.</p><p>Ethical Boundaries and Responsible Use</p><p>No discussion of AI face swap is complete without addressing ethics. The same realism that makes the technology impressive can also make it dangerous if misused.</p><p>Responsible platforms build safeguards into their systems. These may include consent requirements, content moderation, and limitations on certain use cases. Transparency is equally important. When viewers know that a video uses face swap technology, the relationship remains honest.</p><p>From a broader perspective, digital literacy plays a key role. As audiences become more aware of how video face swap works, they are better equipped to evaluate what they see online. This shared understanding reduces the risk of manipulation while allowing creative and practical uses to flourish.</p><p>Why Search Engines Are Paying Attention</p><p>From an SEO and content standpoint, video face swap sits at the intersection of AI innovation, digital media, and online identity—three areas search engines actively prioritize.</p><p>High-quality content in this space performs well because it addresses real user intent: understanding how the technology works, where it’s used, and what tools are available. Articles that demonstrate depth, technical clarity, and real-world context tend to be indexed quickly and ranked more reliably.</p><p>This is where expertise matters. Surface-level explanations no longer stand out. Search engines increasingly reward content that shows genuine understanding, connects concepts logically, and offers practical insight rather than promotional fluff.</p><p>What the Future Looks Like</p><p>Video face swap technology is still evolving. Models are becoming more efficient, requiring less data while producing better results. Real-time face swap in live video calls is already emerging, hinting at a future where digital identity becomes even more fluid.</p><p>At the same time, regulation, platform policies, and user expectations will shape how the technology is used. The most successful tools will be those that balance capability with responsibility.</p><p>For creators, businesses, and everyday users, the message is clear: AI face swap is not just a trend. It’s a new layer of digital expression that, when used thoughtfully, expands what’s possible without erasing authenticity.</p><p>Understanding AI Face Swap: From Entertainment to Industry Use Cases</p><p>Why Midi Dresses Are the Most Flattering Length for All Occasions</p>"

In fact, they welcome positive developments under Mahama’s leadership as long as they are in the best interests of the country. \n\nFor the NPP, the ultimate goal is to present a fresh vision for Ghana’s future, one that builds on existing successes while offering new possibilities for the nation.</p>"

They argued that the 2025 minimum of GHC396.58 was “woefully inadequate to even cover medication,” leaving recipients as “a burden on others for their sustenance.”</p><p>The group is now challenging SSNIT to clarify “what a minimum pension in Ghana is,” pointing to conflicting statements in the Trust’s own announcements.</p><p>They highlighted that SSNIT’s 2025 release stated the minimum pension rose from GHC300 to GHC396.58, while the 2026 announcement referred to an “increase in the minimum monthly pension for new pensioners from GHC300.00 to GHC400.00.”</p><p>“The annual increments are detached from the lived reality of pensioners,” the forum stated. “The current debate, focused on percentage adjustments, overlooks the fundamental question of whether pension income can cover basic survival needs, such as food and medicine.”</p><p>The pensioners argue that without a fundamental policy change, their dignity remains under threat, “especially as healthcare costs continue to rise with age.”</p><p>As a solution, the CSPF is demanding an “urgent inclusive national dialogue” involving SSNIT, government ministries, labour unions, and civil society to establish a “sustainable, livable pension framework.”</p><p>“Pensioners have served Ghana with dedication and deserve to live with dignity, not in destitution,” the release concluded.</p><p>The group vowed to continue engaging with authorities to seek “pension justice, equity, and policies that ensure a dignified life for all pensioners in Ghana.”</p>"

But on Tuesday, January 6, they apprehended him in the Virginia area and took him away,” Ayine said.</p><p>The attorney-general said Ofori-Atta’s visa was revoked in July 2025 and that he was given until 29 November 2025, to voluntarily leave the United States. He said the revocation resulted in the loss of Ofori-Atta’s lawful immigration status.</p><p>“It is not exactly about immigration. His visa was revoked.

He noted that former United States Vice President Kamala Harris previously lived in the same building before moving out after her election, selling her two-bedroom apartment for about $1.85 million at the time.</p><p><br></p><p>He added that while it is unclear whether Mr Ofori-Atta owns or rents the apartment, sources indicate that he had been living there until the morning of January 6, when authorities reportedly surrounded the building and took him into custody.</p><p><br></p><p>Manasseh further disclosed that the arrest occurred at about 11 a.m. on Tuesday as the former finance minister was exiting the building.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>“He was arrested at the Westlight building, which is located at 1111,24th Street in Northwest Washington, D.C., and we are told this is a very expensive residential area in Washington, D.C., located about 20 minutes’ walk from the White House.</p><p><br></p><p>“Some of the people who have lived in this facility include the immediate past Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris. She had a two-bedroom apartment in this building and moved out when she was elected Vice President. We know the cost of that facility, I mean, the two-bedroom apartment in that complex, she sold it for $1.85 million at the time she was leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>“So we’re told it’s a very expensive facility, secure, and prominent people live there. We don’t know whether Ken Ofori-Atta has bought the facility or he’s renting, but sources say this is where he’s been living, going in and out, until the morning of January 6, when the authorities surrounded him and drove him to his current detention centre,” he said.</p><p><br></p><p>He added that the manner of the arrest suggests it was a targeted operation, noting that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is typically associated with mass arrests in public places.</p><p><br></p><p>“When we talk about ICE, I think those who watch foreign news and sometimes social media, these officials go around to enforce the immigration policy of the US. So most of their activity, sometimes they go to public places, factories, and other places to do mass sweeps and arrests. But in the case of Ken Ofori-Atta, we are hearing it was like a targeted operation.</p><p><br></p><p>“It wasn’t like a mass sweep, and as we know, this is a high-end residential complex. So it appears they went there purposely to arrest him, and once they got him into the car, they moved,” he added.</p><p><br></p>"

But if they continue to kill Christians, it will be a many-time strike,\" he said.</p><p><br></p><p>Nigeria's government has rejected Trump's earlier accusations that it is failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks, saying that \"Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\" are targeted.</p><p><br></p><p>Claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians began circulating last year in some right-wing US circles - but organisations monitoring political violence in Nigeria say most victims of the jihadist groups are Muslims.</p><p><br></p><p>When questioned about this in the interview published on Thursday, Trump replied: \"I think that Muslims are being killed also in Nigeria. But it's mostly Christians.\"</p><p><br></p><p>A spokesperson for Nigeria's foreign minister did not directly comment on the possibility of more air strikes but told the BBC: \"We will continue to engage constructively and work with partners, including the United States, on the basis of mutual respect, international law, and Nigeria's sovereignty.</p><p><br></p><p>''Nigeria remains committed to protecting all citizens, Christians and Muslims alike, without discrimination,'' said Alkasim Abdulkadir.</p><p><br></p><p>Nigeria's population of more than 230 million people is roughly evenly divided among Christians, who predominate in the south, and Muslims, who are mostly in the north.</p><p><br></p><p>For the past 15 years, the north-east of the country has suffered from a devastating Islamist insurgency at the hands of jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and those affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) group, based in Borno state.</p><p><br></p><p>The country also faces an array of other complex security issues in different regions, including criminal kidnapping gangs, clashes over land and separatist unrest.</p><p><br></p><p>The US's Christmas Day strikes hit two camps run by a jihadist group called Lakurawa in the largely Muslim state of Sokoto, in north-western Nigeria near the border with Niger. It is still unclear if there were any casualties as neither the US nor Nigerian government has provided figures - and there has been no update on the outcome of the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Lakurawa established a foothold in the border region a few years ago and hails from areas north of Nigeria in the Sahel.</p><p><br></p><p>The US and Nigerian government said after last month's airstrikes that the militants were linked to IS groups in the Sahel - although IS has not linked itself to any of the group's activities or announced ties to Lakurawa as it has done with other groups in the region that it backs.</p><p><br></p><p>In the wake of the strikes, Nigeria's Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC that it had been a \"joint operation\" and \"nothing to do with a particular religion\".</p><p><br></p><p>Referring to the timing of the strikes, he said they did not have \"anything to do with Christmas\" - though Trump said he had ordered them as a \"Christmas present\".</p><p><br></p><p>The foreign minister added that the strikes had had the explicit approval of Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu and the involvement of the country's armed forces.</p>"

It noted that the 2025 minimum of GH¢396.58 was insufficient even to cover medication for some retirees, forcing many to depend on others to survive.</p><p>The Forum said it met SSNIT officials on December 10, 2025, and was assured that its concerns would be forwarded to approving authorities. However, it has now asked SSNIT to clarify apparent discrepancies in public statements on the 2025 and 2026 minimum pension figures and to clearly define what constitutes the minimum pension in Ghana.</p><p>Beyond technical debates over indexation percentages, the Forum warned that many pensioners still struggle to afford food, medicine and basic healthcare.</p><p>It argued that national attention must shift from percentage increases to whether pensions can sustain a dignified standard of living.</p><p>The group is therefore calling for a broad national dialogue that brings together SSNIT, policymakers, organised labour, pensioner groups, economists and civil society to set a realistic national minimum pension and build a sustainable pension system.</p><p>Without such reform, it said, the well-being of retirees will remain at risk as healthcare costs rise with age.</p><p>The Forum reaffirmed its commitment to continued engagement with SSNIT and relevant state institutions to pursue pension justice, equity and policies that allow retirees to live in dignity rather than deprivation.</p>"

Though Combs allegedly wrote Trump a letter seeking clemency, Trump confirmed he is not considering granting Combs’ request.</p><p>After he told reporters that Combs “asked me for a pardon… through a letter,” the president was asked when the alleged communication was sent. Trump said, “Oh, would you like to see that letter?” but did not bring it forth.</p><p>Trump previously revealed to reporters in the Oval Office on Oct. 6 that the Bad Boy Records founder, who is appealing both his sentence and conviction as he serves a 50-month prison sentence in New Jersey, had asked for a pardon. It is unclear whether Combs sent the president any new communication since Trump’s October comments.</p><p>In an Oct. 21 statement to USA TODAY, a White House spokesperson said there is “zero truth” to a report that the president was deliberating commuting Combs’ sentence.</p><p>“The president, not anonymous sources, is the final decider on pardons and commutations,” the official added.</p><p>Trump opened up in a previous interview about having a soured relationship with the embattled rapper, telling Newsmax host Rob Finnerty in an Aug. 1 interview that Combs’ “hostile” comments during Trump’s first presidential term made it “more difficult” to consider a pardon.</p><p>“Well, he was essentially, I guess sort of, half-innocent. I don’t know what they do, he’s still in jail or something,” Trump said. “He was celebrating a victory, but I guess it wasn’t as good of a victory.”</p><p>During the interview, Trump said “probably…” before pausing and revealing to Finnerty, “You know, I was very friendly with him. I got along with him great; seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well, but when I ran for office he was very hostile.”</p><p>When Finnerty clarified by asking if it was “more likely a no for (pardoning) Combs,” Trump replied, “I’d say so.”</p><p>On July 2, following a nearly two-month trial, a 12-person jury delivered a bombshell split decision. They found Combs guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution – charges related to former girlfriends Casandra “Cassie” Ventura Fine and “Jane,” who both testified. However, he was acquitted of the most serious charges, which were racketeering and two counts of sex trafficking.</p>"

Projects currently receiving attention include the Agenda 111 hospitals, VAMED health facilities, the Suame Interchange, Sewua and Afari hospitals, the KNUST Medical Centre, Kejetia Market Phase II, Krofrom Market, the expansion of Prempeh I International Airport (Phase IV), and the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital maternity block.</p><p>According to the Minister, emergency repair works were also undertaken on critical infrastructure such as the Kaase, Kotokuom and Jacobu bridges, as well as sections around the Airport Roundabout in Kumasi, to prevent further deterioration ahead of the next construction phase.</p><p>“The first quarter of 2026 will signal the start of coordinated, large-scale delivery,” Dr Amoakohene said, adding that government remains determined to convert “plans into action, budgets into projects, and projects into real improvements in the lives of the people.”</p>"

And when lawyers talk in this pedestrian manner, I got a bit worried.”</p><p>He questioned why Mr Amaliba would assume that the former Finance Minister’s lawyers in Ghana are not in contact with their counterparts in the United States.</p><p>“What does he know about engagement between American lawyers and lawyers?” he asked. “If he’s doing a case in Ghana, and there’s another leg in America, is he trying to suggest that American lawyers will not give him feedback as to what is happening?”</p><p>Mr Davies added that lawyers should avoid speaking publicly on matters they do not fully understand.</p><p>“When people have little knowledge of something, it is better for them to keep quiet rather than go around embarrassing themselves and saying all kinds of things because they want to be heard on the radio or television,” he said.</p><p>“It is needless. I would say that his government is in power. Sedinam Tamakloe-Attionu has been convicted, regularly and legally, by a court of competent jurisdiction. She’s a criminal fugitive, and she is in America. Tell him that while he’s talking about Ken, he should tell his Attorney General to also start extradition proceedings to bring Sedinam to Ghana to come and answer for her crime.”</p><p>On the issue of Mr Ofori-Atta’s detention, Mr Davies confirmed that legal action has already been taken in the United States.</p><p>“The lawyers in America have filed the process in court to challenge his custody in ICE detention,” he said.</p><p>He explained that the case will be heard later this month and questioned what Mr Amaliba expected the US lawyers to be saying publicly at this stage.</p><p>“That process will be heard later this month. What does he expect the lawyers in America to be saying?” Mr Davies asked.</p><p>“That is why we are here as lawyers, because we have collaboration and teamwork with American lawyers.”</p>"

When it comes to fuel, do you know that Ghana is a net exporter of crude? So, if the prices [of oil] are going up, it means you have to benefit from it because we are also exporting crude.

      "content": "<p>Ghanaian songstress and entrepreneur, Belinda Nana Ekua Amoah, popularly known as Mzbel has shared her perspective on the biblical “number of the beast,” explaining that she believes it already exists rather than being a future event.</p><p>Speaking in a candid interview with renowned blogger, Zion Felix, Mzbel argued that the famous 666, widely referenced in the Bible as the “number of the beast,” is embodied in the internet and modern technology that people rely on daily.</p><p>According to her, anyone who uses a smartphone or accesses the internet has, in one way or another, already embraced what she describes as the feared biblical symbol.</p><p>“People are waiting for the beast to appear, but it’s already here. 666 is already here and it’s the internet we all use. If you don’t use a smartphone and the internet, then you haven’t taken it, but if you use a smartphone and the internet, then you have already embraced it,” Mzbel stated.</p><p>She explained that life itself is deeply spiritual and interconnected, including technology such as mobile phones, television, and even modern financial transactions. In her view, these tools are not neutral but carry spiritual significance that influences how humans live and interact.</p><p>The music diva further noted that it is nearly impossible for people to live without these technologies, making everyone an automatic participant in systems often associated with fear and prophecy.</p><p>When asked directly whether she herself had taken the 666, the singer responded humorously, saying she had, describing herself as an “ambassador” because she cannot live even a minute without internet access—a reality she believes applies to most people today.</p><p>The ’16years’ hitmaker made these comment while discussing the spiritual dimensions of digital music platforms such as iTunes, Spotify, and other streaming services. According to Mzbel, these platforms go beyond business and are spiritually connected to musicians and content creators.</p><p>“And all those music platforms, they are all spiritual platforms. They call it technology or science because they want it to sound nice in your ear, but it is spiritual and it’s not free. If you are a musician and put your songs there, it’s a spiritual trade. They take your energy,” she said.</p><p>Read Also: Why i stopped employing Ga people &#8211; Mzbel</p><p>She stressed that everything surrounding modern music distribution is spiritually linked, whether people acknowledge it or not.</p><p>Mzbel’s comments also reconnect with her long-held position on religion. Several years ago, the musician publicly denounced Christianity and has since maintained that stance. She reiterated that her decision was influenced by what she describes as the failure of many Christians to practice what they preach.</p><p>According to her, she finds peace and alignment in African spirituality, which she says resonates more with her values and personal beliefs. She emphasized that she has no intention of returning to Christianity, a religion founded on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Adam Ro Music Ltd Announces International Media Travel Program</p><p>Amaarae Sets The Benchmark with Blackout Concert</p>"

His form has sparked debate among fans and analysts, many of whom believe Asare could struggle to walk straight back into the starting lineup.\n\nHowever, speaking to Top Sports, Ouattara insisted that the hierarchy at Hearts remains unchanged despite Agbasi’s impressive run.\n\nEx-Chelsea player Lamisha Musonda reveals he has just a few days left to live\n\n“Solomon Agbasi is doing extremely well, but the fact is Benjamin Asare still remains the number one for Hearts of Oak, and he needs to take over when he is fully fit,” Ouattara said.\n\nBeyond the domestic battle, Asare is also facing mounting pressure on the international front. \n\nAs Ghana’s undisputed first-choice goalkeeper, his prolonged absence from competitive football is raising concerns about his readiness to lead the Black Stars heading into the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nWith Agbasi now playing regularly at club level while Asare watches from the sidelines, sections of the football public believe the Hearts captain may need to consider a move elsewhere if he cannot quickly regain his place, in order to preserve his Black Stars number-one status before the World Cup.\n\nFKA/AE</p>"

That was the objective.</p><p>“Unfortunately, Morocco stopped us in our tracks. We will go back calmly and continue our progression.”</p><p>Pagou was only appointed to lead Cameroon on the eve of the finals, stepping up from a more junior role after Belgian Marc Brys was sacked in controversial style by the Cameroonian Football Federation and its president Samuel Eto’o, who was in attendance in Rabat.</p><p>Cameroon left several senior players, including goalkeeper Andre Onana, out of the squad, preferring to bring a more youthful selection to Morocco.</p><p>Among those to impress was Bayer Leverkusen striker Christian Kofane, who made his international debut in the group match against Ivory Coast and scored goals against Mozambique and South Africa – having made his professional debut in Spain’s second tier only a year ago.</p><p>“We have such a good group, such a quality group – young as well, so that’s positive for the future,” said Mbeumo.</p><p>Diaz is Morocco’s ‘X-factor’</p><p>Image source: Getty Images</p><p>Image caption: Brahim Diaz has scored five goals in five games at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, a record for Morocco at a tournament</p><p>The hesitancy of some of Cameroon’s young players in the first half was likely influenced by the fiery atmosphere in the stadium.</p><p>Morocco head coach Walid Regragui said his side had “12 players” and had turned in potentially their best performance since their historic run to the semi-finals of the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar.</p><p>“Amazing” is how goalscorer Saibari described the environment created by the fans.</p><p>“They were supporting us from minute one to 95. I hope they still keep this vibe so we can work harder for them,” he added.</p><p>Morocco have reached their first Afcon semi-final since 2004 and are looking to claim only their second continental title, having last lifted the trophy 50 years ago.</p><p>“It has been a long time for Moroccan football and the Moroccan people,” said defender Romain Saiss, who has not played since picking up an injury in the opening match against Comoros.</p><p>“We wanted tonight to make history and to break this bad record.</p><p>“We’re happy with the game, the way we play, the desire, the intensity we put in the game. The mentality was amazing.”</p><p>The former Wolves man described Diaz as one of the team’s “technical leaders”, saying that when he is in good form it makes things “easier”.</p><p>The Real Madrid playmaker is the tournament’s top scorer, having bagged three goals in the group stage, the winner against Tanzania in the last 16 and another against Cameroon.</p><p>Regragui described him as Morocco’s best player and their “X factor”.</p><p>“If he scores (it) is very important for us, but what is important is you work for the team, you do what I want and you believe in what I want,” he said.</p><p>“He changed his mentality.

Those claims had raised questions about the circumstances surrounding his continued stay in the country.</p><p><br></p><p>Appearing on Joy News’ Newsfile, Dr Ayine explained that the former minister’s visa was cancelled in July 2024, after which US authorities granted him a window to leave voluntarily. “I want Ghanaians to know that he just didn’t overstay his visa. The visa was actually revoked,” Dr Ayine said. “They gave him up to November 29 of 2024 to leave the United States. He did not.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mr Ofori-Atta, who left Ghana last year on medical grounds according to his legal team, has since been the subject of extradition proceedings initiated by the Ghanaian government. His lawyers have resisted the request, insisting that the allegations against him are politically motivated.</p><p>Confirmation of his detention later emerged from the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which published his details on its official website. The listing showed that Mr Ofori-Atta was being held at the Caroline Detention Facility in Virginia and is scheduled to appear before a US court on Tuesday, January 20, 2026.</p><p><br></p><p>In a public notice issued by his Ghana-based lawyers, Minkah-Premo, Osei-Bonsu, Bruce-Cathline and Partners, the legal team stated that the former minister had already applied for an adjustment of his immigration status and expressed confidence that the issue would be resolved.</p><p>Dr Ayine further disclosed that Mr Ofori-Atta’s arrest did not occur as initially planned. According to him, US authorities had intended to apprehend the former minister on January 4, 2026, but the move fell through. He said Mr Ofori-Atta was eventually arrested on Tuesday, January 6, in the Virginia area and taken into custody.</p><p><br></p><p>The Attorney General cautioned against treating the matter as a simple immigration breach, arguing that the revocation of the visa was deliberate and connected to ongoing investigations.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is not exactly about immigration. His visa is not expired. It expires in February. No, it was revoked. I am telling you this on authority,” he emphasised.</p><p>Dr Ayine also disclosed that the decision by US authorities followed sustained engagement with Ghanaian officials, particularly in relation to an extradition request submitted by his office.</p><p><br></p><p>“The extradition request that I sent was in respect of the OSP – the SME matter,” he said. “I have been working with the Americans diligently on him. And the visa was revoked. And that is how come that he lost his immigration status in the United States.”</p><iframe class=\"ql-video ql-align-center\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?gdpr=0&amp;us_privacy=1---&amp;gpp_sid=-1&amp;client=ca-pub-5510276167635361&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;slotname=9768827792&amp;adk=1251993338&amp;adf=825568878&amp;pi=t.ma~as.9768827792&amp;w=336&amp;lmt=1768057946&amp;format=336x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.graphic.com.gh%2Fnews%2Fgeneral-news%2Fken-ofori-attas-us-visa-was-revoked-he-did-not-overstay-ayine-reveals.html&amp;aieuf=1&amp;aicrs=1&amp;uach=WyJXaW5kb3dzIiwiMTkuMC4wIiwieDg2IiwiIiwiMTQzLjAuNzQ5OS4xNzAiLG51bGwsMCxudWxsLCI2NCIsW1siR29vZ2xlIENocm9tZSIsIjE0My4wLjc0OTkuMTcwIl0sWyJDaHJvbWl1bSIsIjE0My4wLjc0OTkuMTcwIl0sWyJOb3QgQShCcmFuZCIsIjI0LjAuMC4wIl1dLDBd&amp;abgtt=6&amp;dt=1768058339086&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=2334&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20260107&amp;mjsv=m202601070101&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D5533bda8d8dc8e6a%3AT%3D1749723104%3ART%3D1768058339%3AS%3DALNI_MaupwWDUIyZQ_GyEeFmM_BAEVbZAw&amp;gpic=UID%3D000010dc173c5dfe%3AT%3D1749723104%3ART%3D1768058339%3AS%3DALNI_Maunx-tyNemQlkRVKFCNNQTw-_2mw&amp;eo_id_str=ID%3D73fc7fc999e029a9%3AT%3D1754919080%3ART%3D1768058339%3AS%3DAA-AfjZyGalcV9S610aLGGGyFupP&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C336x280%2C336x280%2C336x280&amp;nras=1&amp;correlator=6712613815678&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;u_tz=60&amp;u_his=5&amp;u_h=720&amp;u_w=1280&amp;u_ah=672&amp;u_aw=1280&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1.5&amp;dmc=8&amp;adx=412&amp;ady=3640&amp;biw=1265&amp;bih=585&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=1303&amp;eid=31096043%2C95376583%2C95380025%2C31096172&amp;oid=2&amp;psts=AOrYGsnsiZoijjl_tD4Sj75NKb693CI1hxat6HN8HbPDDaLXUkNsipvjzDISr_ESG5q6pDgsSTpxfwJIKsr1wQQJx56l0jSiZ9hBmeJz9DuF1Y3gOg%2CAOrYGsl9R-8sBq5Q7j47uNQnv6fVJIEY060RwXTISIEPHQL9c6iHS25eujOdraurHtpTfPVttQK0Yr6vmD-EbdDBUZzE_9lyANLnj7v4oub21E2xZg&amp;pvsid=958571677259029&amp;tmod=17650955&amp;uas=3&amp;nvt=1&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.graphic.com.gh%2F&amp;fc=1920&amp;brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1280%2C0%2C1280%2C672%2C1280%2C585&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7CeEbr%7C&amp;abl=CS&amp;pfx=0&amp;fu=0&amp;bc=31&amp;bz=1&amp;pgls=CAg.&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=4&amp;fsb=1&amp;dtd=2797\" height=\"280\" width=\"336\"></iframe><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><br></p>"

      "content": "<p>The Concerned SSNIT Pensioners Forum (CSPF) has criticised the Social Security and National Insurance Trust’s (SSNIT) announcement of a 10 per cent average pension increase for 2026, describing it as inadequate and incapable of easing the economic hardship facing retirees, particularly those on low incomes.</p><p>In a statement issued on January 10, the Forum said while it appreciates the upward adjustment, the increase fails to address the deep erosion in the real value of pensions and does little to prevent pensioner poverty at a time when the cost of living continues to rise sharply.</p><p>The Forum recalled that on November 19, 2025, it petitioned SSNIT to urgently raise the minimum pension to a livable level and correct what it describes as long-standing injustices in the annual indexation of pensions.</p><p>Copies of the petition were also sent to the Minister for Finance, the Minister of Employment and Labour Relations, and the Chief Executive Officer of the National Pensions Authority, seeking their intervention.</p><p>According to the Forum, the petition proposed that the 2026 pension adjustment should restore part of the value lost over the years by raising the minimum monthly pension to GH¢600 and granting an average increase of between 15 and 20 per cent.</p><p>It argued that the 2025 minimum pension payment of GH¢396.58 was grossly insufficient, noting that some pensioners on this amount struggle to afford medication and have become dependent on others for basic survival.</p><p>The Forum said it met with SSNIT on December 10, 2025, and was assured that the petition would be forwarded to the relevant approving authorities.</p><p>However, it has since raised concerns over what it describes as inconsistencies in SSNIT’s public statements on minimum pension levels for 2025 and 2026.</p><p>It pointed to a January 6, 2025 press release in which SSNIT stated that the minimum monthly pension would rise from GH¢300 in 2024 to GH¢396.58 in 2025, and a January 8, 2026 release which indicated that the minimum pension for new pensioners would increase from GH¢300 to GH¢400, with some pensioners expected to receive GH¢409.56 after indexation and redistribution.</p><p>The CSPF is therefore calling on SSNIT to clarify what constitutes a minimum pension in Ghana, stressing that percentage increases alone are meaningless without a guaranteed minimum living pension.</p><p>It warned that many pensioners still cannot afford food, medicine or basic healthcare, making annual increments disconnected from the lived realities of the elderly.</p><p>The Forum is advocating for the adoption of a national minimum pension policy, similar to the national minimum wage, to ensure retirees can live with dignity.</p><p>\"We therefore call for an urgent inclusive national dialogue involving SSNIT, policymakers, organized labour, pensioner associations, economic planners, and civil society to establish a sustainable, livable pension framework and set a realistic minimum pension benchmark.</p><p>\"Without this fundamental policy shift, the dignity and well-being of Ghana’s retirees will remain under threat, especially as healthcare costs continue to rise with age. Pensioners have served Ghana with dedication and deserve to live with dignity, not in destitution.\"</p><p>The CSPF said it will continue engaging SSNIT and relevant institutions in its pursuit of pension justice, equity and policies that safeguard the dignity and wellbeing of pensioners across the country.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Investigative journalist Manasseh Azure Awuni has indicated that the arrest and detention of former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was a targeted operation.\n\nIn a detailed post on his Facebook page on Saturday, January 10, 2026, Manasseh Azure stated that Ofori-Atta was apprehended by ICE agents as he emerged from his apartment. \n\nAG Ayine confirms Ofori-Atta arrest was due to extradition request\n\nHe further revealed that, according to his sources, the former minister was surrounded, placed in a vehicle, and taken to a detention facility, where he is currently being held.\n\n“… The operation to arrest him, according to sources, appeared targeted, unlike the ongoing raids and swoops at factories and public places where mass arrests by ICE are conducted.\n\n“Ken Ofori-Atta was emerging from a magnificent luxury apartment building, where he had been living in the US, when agents surrounded him, led him into a vehicle, and drove him away to a detention facility 89 miles away. He was driven to the Caroline Detention Facility in Virginia, about an hour and a half drive from where he was arrested,” Azure shared.\n\nMeanwhile, the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine, has confirmed that the arrest of the former Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, by ICE agents in the United States was due to his extradition request.\n\nAccording to Dr Ayine, the US State Department revoked Ofori-Atta’s visa in July (sic) and gave him until November 29 to leave the country. His failure to comply prompted enforcement action.\n\nAG drops details of confidential conversation he had with 'top' US lawyers of Ofori-Atta\n\n“The visa was actually revoked. So, it's not that Ofori-Atta overstayed. So, in July, the American State Department revoked his visa, and they gave him up to November 29 (sic) to leave the United States. He did not. And then, that is how come that they decided they were going to now pursue him, and arrest him.\n\n\"Actually, the arrest was supposed to occur on January 4th [2026], and they did not do so, but on Tuesday, January 6, 2026, they apprehended him in the Virginia area and took him into custody,” he explained.\n\n\n\nMAG/AE</p>"

      "content": "<p>By Dr. Emmanuel Acquah-Sam (An Economist)</p><p>As the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and Ghana approach critical internal party contests, particularly on 31st January 2026, the increasing trend of public insults, character assassination, and the airing of internal grievances on media platforms is deeply worrying.</p><p>Political competition is healthy, but political self-destruction is always bad. When party members and aspirants begin to empty their dirty wardrobes in public, they do not weaken their internal opponents alone, but also strengthen the opposition, damage party and national cohesion, and erode democratic credibility.</p><p>This piece is meant to cool political tempers, restore discipline, and protect Ghana’s democracy. It speaked to all political parties to mind their utterances before, during, and after elections.</p><p>Every insult, allegation, and public taunt becomes ready ammunition for political opponents the trigger defeat. The broader effect eill be felt during and after the 2028 general elections.</p><p>Reconciliation after primaries may become nearly impossible. Words spoken in anger leave deeper scars than cutlass wounds.</p><p>History shows that parties that enter elections bruised rarely win power. Ensuring unity after bitter internal warfare is difficult.</p><p>The chosen leader will lose credibility for the 2028 general elections.</p><p>A flagbearer must appear as a unifier, statesman, and credible alternative, especially when competing against a government that can point to visible performance and macroecononic stability.</p><p>Those who insult, malign, and undermine their own party leaders today should remember that tomorrow’s government positions are not awarded to yesterday’s saboteurs. Political memory is said to be long.</p><p>Additionally, the party will lose international confidence and development support when in power.\nInternational partners value stability, discipline, and political maturity.</p><p>Chronic internal chaos sends negative signals to outsiders, discouraging investment, cooperation, and the inflow of development assistance.</p><p>Internal political toxicity further pushes young Ghanaians from democratic participation, weakening the future of the country and and its democratic values.</p><p>What political aspirants and leaders normalise today becomes the culture tomorrow. If insults replace ideas, Ghana risks sliding from competitive democracy into destructive populism.</p><p>We humbly call for wisdom, restraint, and national interest from all and sundry to ensure peace in parties and Ghana.</p><p>Leadership is not proven by the loudness of insults but by the depth of ideas, discipline of speech, and capacity for restraint and good quality national governance.</p><p>Global lessons abound for political and economic sanity in Ghana. The political and economic turmoil experienced in Venezuela, and the persistent institutional tensions in Nigeria, and swiftness with which they have been tackled under the President Trump’s era, must remind us that reckless politics eventually punishes everyone.</p><p>Politics should be a contest of ideas and not insults. Power sought without discipline becomes a burden. It is our responsibility to speak with wisdom, contest with dignity, and build our economy with peace for long-term economic growth and development.</p><p>As Adam Smith postulated in the 18th century, human action is driven less by benevolence and more by self-interest. Citizens must therefore understand that much of the hostility and reckless speeches in the quest for power reflects personal political interests, not necessarily the pursuit of national priorities. This awareness should guide the public to demand restraint, civility, and issue-based discourse, knowing that peaceful elections depend as much on an the alertness of all.</p><p>Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine, has shared details of a confidential conversation he had with high-profile US lawyers representing former Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta.\n\nSpeaking on NewsFile on JoyNews on Saturday, January 10, 2026, Dr Ayine recounted that former US Attorney General John Ashcroft, who is part of Ofori-Atta’s legal team, reached out to him to discuss concerns about ensuring a fair trial for the former minister upon his return to Ghana.\n\nSee details of the US ICE facility where Ken Ofori-Atta is being held\n\n“John Ashcroft, the former Attorney General of the United States of America called me and said he was the one representing Ken Ofori-Atta in the matter, but his concerns and reason for calling me was for me to assure him that when Ken is returned to Ghana, he'll get a fair trial.\n\n“And I assured him of the fact that under this government and in accordance with Article 19 of the constitution, his right to a fair trial is guaranteed. Ken Ofori-Atta is not a person that will come here, and we're going to treat him very shabbily and so on and so forth. He will be accorded due process of law. His fair trial rights will be guaranteed, and so on,” he disclosed.\n\nHe added that the conversation also included two other lawyers, and at the time, the discussions were strictly confidential.\n\n“So, I talked with John Ashcroft, including the lawyer who granted the interview [Enayat Qasimi], so there were three of them; three lawyers who spoke to me via Zoom on that day when they were expressing concerns. So, at that point in time, it was confidential. I could not mention John Ashcroft as his lawyer,” he stated.\n\nDr Ayine also explained why he had earlier described the lawyers as ‘top,’ a comment that drew some criticism from the public.\n\n“But I was simply saying that when you take the fact that he has these top lawyers coming to court in America to defend him, it is not going to be a day's work to bring him home,” he explained.\n\nThe AG further explained the legal process Ofori-Atta may face in the US, including appearing before an immigration judge on January 20, 2026, with the right to appeal through the district court, circuit court of appeals, and potentially the US Supreme Court. \n\nHe also noted that any extradition proceedings would follow a similar multi-level judicial pathway.\n\n“In this current matter, he will appear before an immigration judge on January 20th [2026]. He has a right to appeal that decision to a district court. From the district court, it can go to a circuit court of appeals. Then from there to the United States Supreme Court. That is potentially the legal pathway to the determination as to whether or not he should be taken from America. If he doesn't self-deport, this is what is going to happen.\n\nWhat We Know: Ken Ofori-Atta's visa, ICE detention and Feburary 14 deadline\n\n“In the extradition case, again, a district court will hear the proceedings and make a determination as to whether to extradite him. If he's not happy about that, he can go to a circuit court of appeal and to the United States of America,” he explained.\n\nMAG/AE</p>"

Mothers, fathers and family members clapped, shouted names and waved encouragement, turning the stadium into a warm and supportive environment. \n\nEven when a child stumbled or finished last, they were still greeted with hugs and applause.\n\nBeyond the medals and finishing positions, the Junior Olympics served a bigger purpose: nurturing confidence, discipline and a love for sport.

      "content": "<p>The Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine has confirmed that the arrest of the former Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, by ICE agents in the United States was due to his US visa being revoked following an extradition request.\n\nSpeaking on JoyNews Newsfile on Saturday, January 10, 2026, Dr Ayine said that Ofori-Atta's detention is part of ongoing extradition processes, clarifying that it is linked to the revocation of his US visa and not a routine immigration overstay.\n\n\"I didn't make this public, but I started investigating Ofori-Atta. In fact, in his case, I'm doing it with some foreign investigators who are tracking all the offshore dealings and so on. We are also doing our own investigations here. They are inconclusive, as we speak. I mean, we have not come to any conclusion,\" Dr Ayine revealed.\n\nKen Ofori-Atta arrest resulted from extradition request – AG Ayine confirms\n\nDescribing the investigations as serious and potentially far-reaching, the Attorney General emphasised that collaboration with US authorities began long before the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) issued any public statements.\n\n\"So, I started working with the Americans in respect of Ofori-Atta long before OSP came up with the announcement. I started working with them, and I want Ghanaians to know that he just didn't overstay his visa,\" he clarified.\n\nAccording to Dr Ayine, the US State Department revoked Ofori-Atta's visa in July and gave him until November 29 to leave the country. His failure to comply prompted enforcement action.\n\n\"The visa was actually revoked. So, it's not that Ofori-Atta overstayed. So, in July, the American State Department revoked his visa, and they gave him up to November 29 to leave the United States. He did not. And then, that is how come that they decided they were going to now pursue him, and arrest him.

      "content": "<p>The Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine has confirmed that the arrest of the former Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, by ICE agents in the United States was due to his extradition request.\n\n Speaking on JoyNews Newsfile on Saturday, January 10, 2026, Dr Ayine said that Ofori-Atta’s detention is part of ongoing extradition processes, clarifying that it is linked to the revocation of his US visa and not a routine immigration overstay.\n\n What We Know: Ken Ofori-Atta's visa, ICE detention and Feburary 14 deadline\n\n “I didn't make this public, but I started investigating Ofori-Atta. In fact, in his case, I'm doing it with some foreign investigators who are tracking all the offshore dealings and so on. We are also doing our own investigations here. They are inconclusive, as we speak. I mean, we have not come to any conclusion,” Dr Ayine revealed.\n\n Describing the investigations as serious and potentially far-reaching, the Attorney General emphasised that collaboration with US authorities began long before the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) issued any public statements.\n\n “So, I started working with the Americans in respect of Ofori-Atta long before OSP came up with the announcement. I started working with them, and I want Ghanaians to know that he just didn't overstay his visa,” he clarified.\n\n According to Dr Ayine, the US State Department revoked Ofori-Atta’s visa in July (sic) and gave him until November 29 to leave the country. His failure to comply prompted enforcement action.\n\n “The visa was actually revoked. So, it's not that Ofori-Atta overstayed. So, in July, the American State Department revoked his visa, and they gave him up to November 29 (sic) to leave the United States. He did not. And then, that is how come that they decided they were going to now pursue him, and arrest him.\n\n \"Actually, the arrest was supposed to occur on January 4th [2026], and they did not do so, but on Tuesday, January 6, 2026, they apprehended him in the Virginia area and took him into custody,” he explained.\n\n He stressed that the matter is far more than an immigration issue.\n\n “It's not exactly about immigration.

Diaz (26), I. Saibari (74)</p><p>Hosts Morocco marched confidently into the semi-finals of the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2025 after a commanding 2-0 victory over Cameroon under the Rabat lights on Friday night.</p><p>Goals in either half from Brahim Díaz and Ismail Saibari sealed a memorable triumph for the Atlas Lions in front of a raucous, sold-out Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium.</p><p>Coming into the quarter-final under pressure following an unconvincing Round of 16 win over Tanzania, the hosts responded in emphatic fashion. Roared on by a deafening home crowd, Morocco delivered a performance brimming with authority, intensity and belief.</p><p>The victory carried extra significance. Not only was it a vital boost in confidence, it also ended a long-standing hoodoo against Cameroon. Morocco had never beaten the Indomitable Lions at AFCON in their previous three meetings, and this marked just their third victory over Cameroon in 13 encounters across all competitions.</p><p>From the opening whistle, the hosts set the tone. Morocco pressed high, dominated possession and pinned Cameroon deep inside their own half. Their early dominance was eventually rewarded in the 26th minute, when tournament talisman Brahim Díaz struck for the fifth time in Rabat.</p><p>The Real Madrid forward showed sharp instincts, deftly guiding the ball into the net with his thigh after Ayoub El Kaabi flicked on a corner delivered by skipper Achraf Hakimi. It was Morocco’s sixth corner inside the opening 25 minutes, a clear reflection of their relentless start.</p><p>The goal was historic for Díaz, who became just the second player in AFCON history — after Ghana’s Osei Kofi — to score in five consecutive matches at the tournament.</p><p>Buoyed by the breakthrough, Morocco continued to dictate the tempo and could have doubled their advantage before the interval. A swift counter-attack saw Abde Ezzalzouli release El Kaabi through on goal, but the striker could only find the side netting from close range.</p><p>Cameroon emerged from the break with renewed energy and greater attacking intent, but they found little joy against a disciplined and well-organised Moroccan backline. Their clearest opportunity came from a set-piece, when Georges-Kevin N’Koudou met a corner with a diving header, only to see his effort miss the target.</p><p>With a quarter of an hour left, Morocco delivered the decisive blow. From an Ezzalzouli free-kick, Nayef Aguerd’s clever touch found Saibari unmarked at the back post, and the midfielder calmly swept a low effort into the bottom corner to ignite wild celebrations in the stands.</p><p>At 2-0 up, with the stadium reverberating to the sound of belief and expectation, Morocco were in full control. Cameroon could not find a response, their hopes of reaching the semi-finals fading as the hosts closed out a famous night in Rabat with authority and composure.</p><p>Ismail Saibari (Morocco) – TotalEnergies Man of the Match</p><p>“It was a very tough match with a lot of intensity. We were strong defensively and, in attack, we managed to score two goals. We work very well as a group in the Moroccan national team and know each other well. We are fighting together to win the title.We have now reached the semi-finals and our aim is to go all the way to the final. Our fans supported us massively and never doubted us. We will now rest, wait to see our semi-final opponent, and then start preparing while correcting the mistakes we made earlier.”</p><p>David Pagou – Cameroon Head Coach</p><p>“I am proud of my players. We competed well against Morocco and we leave the tournament with our heads held high. We faced some difficulties, but we came back well in the second half. The second goal we conceded decided the match. Overall, I am satisfied with the performance. We have a young and new squad, and the players deserve credit for their efforts for the Cameroonian people.There is a bright future for our young players, many of whom are playing in continental competition for the first time. We have learned many lessons and leave the tournament with a lot of positives.”</p><p>Walid Regragui – Morocco Head Coach</p><p>“I want to thank the players and the fans. It truly felt like we were playing with 12 players on the pitch. Qualifying for the semi-finals is well deserved, and the players earned it. I congratulate Cameroon for a strong performance and their coach for his good work. Our players gave everything, and when they stay focused, things go well. I am very happy with what they showed.Brahim Díaz is a special player, and I congratulate him for his performances. We must remain humble because every team wants to beat us, and we must respect all our opponents. Since 2004, Morocco had not reached the semi-finals, and now we are aiming to write history.”</p><p>Ndiaye marked his first start with his first goal at this AFCON to end Mali’s dream</p><p>Senegal booked their place in the semi-finals of the TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations Morocco 2025 after edging Mali 1–0 in a tense quarter-final clash at the Grand Stade de Tanger on Friday night. The match saw Mali reduced to ten men when their captain, Yves Bissouma, was sent off in added time at the end of the first half.</p><p>In a fiercely contested West African derby, the 2021 TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations winners showed composure and tactical discipline to overcome a resilient Malian side. Senegal were guided by coach Pape Thiaw stood tall all evening. With both teams battling intensely for control in midfield and clear chances at a premium, Senegal proved more decisive in the key moments.</p><p>The breakthrough came in the 27th minute when Iliman Ndiaye capitalised on a goalkeeping error from Mali’s Djigui Diarra inside the penalty area. Reacting quickest to the loose ball, the Senegal forward calmly finished from close range to score what proved to be the match-winning goal.</p><p>Mali’s task became significantly more difficult moments before the interval when Bissouma received a second yellow card in stoppage time, forcing the Eagles to play the entire second half with a numerical disadvantage. Despite the setback, Mali reorganised defensively under Tom Saintfiet’s guidance and continued to search for a way back into the contest.</p><p>After the restart, Senegal controlled possession and dictated the tempo, probing patiently for a second goal. Mali defended with determination, and despite the defeat, goalkeeper Djigui Diarra was spectacular, making several key saves to keep the scoreline close and frustrating Senegal’s attacking efforts.</p><p>Senegal, however, managed the closing stages with maturity and control to secure their place in the last four of the competition, while Mali exited the tournament after a courageous and spirited quarter-final performance.</p><p>Senegal will face Saturday’s winner between record champions Egypt and holders Cote D’Ivoire.</p><p>TotalEnergies Man of the Match: Iliman Ndiaye of Senegal:</p><p>\"I am happy to have won this award but the most important thing is that we have progressed to the semi-finals of the competition. We played very well today and it shows that we are improving match after match. I am confident that my colleagues and I will focus on the next match to play at our best level and deliver for our fans.\"</p><p>Mali coach Tom Saintfiet:</p><p>\"It was an interesting and difficult match for us because we had to play large parts of the game with ten men. But that doesn't take away the fact that my players played gallantly and played very well. I am proud of them for the performance they put up not just in today's match but throughout the competition. We have shown the world what we are made of. Together with my staff we will analyse our matches and see what we can do better in future.\"</p><p>Senegal coach Pape Thiaw:</p><p>\"It was not an easy match because we played against a very talented Mali team but we achieved our objective. The Mali team has good qualities and they created many challenges for us. If we had been more clinical in front of goal we could have scored more goals but what is more important today is for us to have qualified for the semi-final. We will look into our errors and look to correct them for our future matches. We hope that we will be more efficient in front of goal and have more luck in future.\"</p><p>Morocco roar past cameroon to book AFCON 2025 Semi-Final spot</p><p>·      Brahim Diaz once again out up a brilliant performance</p><p>·      Morocco remain in hunt for second AFCON title</p><p>·      They will take on the winner between Algeria and Nigeria in the last four</p><p>B. Diaz (26), I. Saibari (74)</p><p>Hosts Morocco marched confidently into the semi-finals of the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2025 after a commanding 2-0 victory over Cameroon under the Rabat lights on Friday night.</p><p>Goals in either half from Brahim Díaz and Ismail Saibari sealed a memorable triumph for the Atlas Lions in front of a raucous, sold-out Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium.</p><p>Coming into the quarter-final under pressure following an unconvincing Round of 16 win over Tanzania, the hosts responded in emphatic fashion. Roared on by a deafening home crowd, Morocco delivered a performance brimming with authority, intensity and belief.</p><p>The victory carried extra significance. Not only was it a vital boost in confidence, it also ended a long-standing hoodoo against Cameroon. Morocco had never beaten the Indomitable Lions at AFCON in their previous three meetings, and this marked just their third victory over Cameroon in 13 encounters across all competitions.</p><p>From the opening whistle, the hosts set the tone. Morocco pressed high, dominated possession and pinned Cameroon deep inside their own half. Their early dominance was eventually rewarded in the 26th minute, when tournament talisman Brahim Díaz struck for the fifth time in Rabat.</p><p>The Real Madrid forward showed sharp instincts, deftly guiding the ball into the net with his thigh after Ayoub El Kaabi flicked on a corner delivered by skipper Achraf Hakimi. It was Morocco’s sixth corner inside the opening 25 minutes, a clear reflection of their relentless start.</p><p>The goal was historic for Díaz, who became just the second player in AFCON history — after Ghana’s Osei Kofi — to score in five consecutive matches at the tournament.</p><p>Buoyed by the breakthrough, Morocco continued to dictate the tempo and could have doubled their advantage before the interval. A swift counter-attack saw Abde Ezzalzouli release El Kaabi through on goal, but the striker could only find the side netting from close range.</p><p>Cameroon emerged from the break with renewed energy and greater attacking intent, but they found little joy against a disciplined and well-organised Moroccan backline. Their clearest opportunity came from a set-piece, when Georges-Kevin N’Koudou met a corner with a diving header, only to see his effort miss the target.</p><p>With a quarter of an hour left, Morocco delivered the decisive blow. From an Ezzalzouli free-kick, Nayef Aguerd’s clever touch found Saibari unmarked at the back post, and the midfielder calmly swept a low effort into the bottom corner to ignite wild celebrations in the stands.</p><p>At 2-0 up, with the stadium reverberating to the sound of belief and expectation, Morocco were in full control. Cameroon could not find a response, their hopes of reaching the semi-finals fading as the hosts closed out a famous night in Rabat with authority and composure.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Tano North MP, Dr Gideon Boako, has suggested that additional losses linked to GoldBod could soon appear in the Bank of Ghana’s audited accounts, beyond the $214 million already reported by the IMF.\n\n In an interview on Thursday, January 8, 2026 Dr Boako said the IMF report, dated September 2025, highlighted trading losses from the Gold for Reserve programme and associated intermediation activities.\n\n He warned that subsequent quarters could see further losses recorded in the official accounts once the Bank of Ghana’s audit is published.\n\n “The losses are coming from two streams,” he said. “The $214 million loss is from GoldBod’s trading activities. But there is another leg of the loss that will come up in the BoG’s audited accounts, and it will be higher.”\n\n Dr Boako explained that the additional losses are connected to how the Bank of Ghana operates its cedi-dollar-gold transactions.\n\n He criticised the current regime, under which cedis are collected from banks to purchase gold at Bloomberg rates, only to sell the resulting dollars back at the Bank of Ghana’s artificially appreciated rate.\n\n Dr Boako attributes this new loss to the additional six tonnes of gold in the Bank of Ghana vault. According to him, because the central bank is currently operating a multiple exchange rate system, a practice criticised by the IMF-Bank of Ghana buys the reserve gold at a higher Bloomberg rate and keeps it in their vault at an artificial rate 10% lower than the Bloomberg rate. This is why Dr Boako strongly believes the auditors of BoG will value the reserve gold at a rate lower than how much it was purchased for, leading to exchange losses.\n\n “The IMF report has said this is not good and will continue to cause more losses,” he added.\n\n He concluded that these emerging figures reflect the policy environment rather than the operational design of GoldBod.\n\n According to Dr Boako, without adjustments to the exchange rate regime, further financial strain on the Bank of Ghana and GoldBod is inevitable.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The Ashanti Regional Branch of Ghana’s leading private sector transport operator, the Ghana Private Roads Transport Union (GPRTU), has rated very favourably the NDC government in its management of the country within its first year since assuming office.\n\nThe government, headed by President John Dramani Mahama, after winning by a historic vote margin in Ghana’s 2024 presidential and parliamentary elections, assumed governance of the nation exactly a year ago.\n\nThen-candidate Mahama went into the presidential polls on the back of a myriad of campaign promises, assuring the people of a better alternative grounded in experience and superior policies, which won the trust and confidence of the voters.\n\nTo mark the government’s first anniversary in office, our Ashanti Regional Correspondent, Nicholas Osei-Wusu, sampled some key stakeholders’ views to gauge their assessment of how the country has been run during the 12-month period and also find out what could have been done better, as well as their expectations in the ensuing years.\n\nThe Ashanti Regional Chairman of the GPRTU, Alhaji Sumaila Boakye, recounted meetings held between the transport operators and the then NDC flagbearer at the instance of the latter during the electioneering period. According to him, the NDC espoused its policies and programmes for the transport sector if it won the election, while the transporters also made requests towards improving the cost of running transport businesses in the country.\n\nAccording to the Regional Chairman of the GPRTU, relative to the campaign promises by then-candidate Mahama and the delivery of his government so far, the performance has been very good, especially in the critical areas of fuel prices and the cost of spare parts.\n\n“When we met in Accra, we made him aware that prices of fuel, which constitute a major cost component of the transport business, needed to reduce or stabilise. At the time, prices at the pump were not only very high but kept increasing by the day.”\n\n“The cedi-dollar rate was also very high and accounted for the high prices of vehicle spare parts on the market,” Alhaji Boakye, who doubles as the Kumasi Branch Chairman of the GPRTU, recounted.\n\nJuxtaposing these with the current economic realities, Alhaji Boakye noted, “After one year, we’re all aware that prices of fuel have reduced significantly, easing the cost of running the transport business. We also responded positively by reviewing our fares downward. The high cost of spare parts has also seen a downward trend. For example, the price of a 12.00 tyre, which was GH¢3,500 in 2024, is now bought at GH¢2,500. As we speak, the price of engine oil has also come down. So we can say the government has performed very well.”\n\nThe GPRTU Regional Chairman, however, urged the government to give serious attention to road construction to ensure that there are better roads for transport operators to ply.\n\n“Government should stop the illegal construction of speed ramps along highways. Some of these road infrastructure damage our vehicles to an extent that they cause fire outbreaks,” he pointed out.\n\nAlhaji Boakye made specific reference to Jamasi in the Sekyere South District in the Ashanti Region along the Kumasi–Ejura Highway, where he said the eight speed ramps are not only too many but their heights are unreasonable for road safety, and therefore called for steps to correct the problem.\n\nAsafo Market in the regional capital, Kumasi, is a known hub for cold store businesses, which rely heavily on power supply for sustainability. One of them is Agya Cold Store. The operator, who gave her name only as Aunty Ama, said she and other cold store owners were apprehensive about a possible return of the unstable electricity supply situation, commonly known as ‘dumsor’, if the NDC won the election. However, she said the government has done very well so far in ensuring sustained power supply stability.\n\n“If the light is not stable, our stock, which includes frozen meat and fish products, spoils, leading to huge losses. But in the last one year, the power supply has been fairly reliable,” she said.\n\nAunty Ama urged the government to do more to ensure them of constant electricity to guarantee their business.\n\nA cross-section of the public sampled also spoke highly of the government’s performance within the one-year period and hoped that it would continue to deliver.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) has increased monthly pensions by 10 per cent for 2026, with the adjustment designed to provide greater relief for pensioners on lower incomes.</p><p><br></p><p>Under the new indexation, all pensioners on the SSNIT Pension Payroll as of December 31, 2025, will receive a fixed increase of six per cent, alongside a redistributed amount of GH¢91.56 drawn from the remaining four per cent.</p><p><br></p><p>Announcing the increase at a press conference in Accra last Thursday, SSNIT said the redistribution was intended to cushion low-earning pensioners amid prevailing economic conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>The Trust explained that the redistribution mechanism is applied to the indexation rate in line with the solidarity principle of social security, to moderate disparities and ensure more meaningful increases for pensioners at the lower end of the scale.</p><p><br></p><p>SSNIT noted that, as a defined benefit scheme, pensions are linked to the salaries on which contributions were paid, making periodic adjustments necessary to help maintain their real value while safeguarding the long-term sustainability of the Fund.</p><p><br></p><p>The 2026 indexation rate, SSNIT said, was determined after considering salary growth among active contributors, projected average inflation of 8 ± 2 per cent by the end of 2025, and the overall impact on the Fund’s long-term sustainability.</p><p><br></p><p>In consultation with the National Pensions Regulatory Authority and in accordance with Section 80 of the National Pensions Act, 2008 (Act 766), SSNIT indexed monthly pensions upwards by 10 per cent for the year 2026.</p><p><br></p><p>With the adjustment, about 70 per cent of pensioners on the payroll are expected to benefit from the full 10 per cent increment or more, due to the redistribution mechanism.</p><p><br></p><p>Pensioners who were on the minimum pension of GH¢300 in 2025 will now receive GH¢409 a month, representing an effective increase of 36.52 per cent. Those in the GH¢500 bracket will see their pensions rise to GH¢621.56, an effective increase of 24.31 per cent.</p><p><br></p><p>Pensioners earning GH¢2,018 a month will now receive GH¢2,220, reflecting an effective increase of 10 per cent, while those on GH¢5,000 will receive GH¢5,391.56, an effective increase of 17.83 per cent.</p><p><br></p><p>The highest pensioner, who previously received GH¢201,792.37, will now earn GH¢213,991.47 a month, representing an effective increase of 6.05 per cent.</p><p><br></p><p>Explaining the structure of the increase, the Chief Actuary of SSNIT, Evelyn Adjei, said: “So if you see, those who are receiving more are receiving less effectively than those who are receiving the minimum pension or the lower bracket pension, and that is to help them get more.”</p><p><br></p><p>She added that indexation comes with significant costs, noting that the 10 per cent increase would cost an additional GH¢616 million.</p><p><br></p><p>Mrs Adjei said Section 80 of the National Pensions Act, Act 766, mandates the Trust to annually review pensions in payment in line with wage inflation or any other rate determined by the Board of Trustees in consultation with the regulator.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s why we do indexation every year. What we do is in line with the law,” she said.</p><p><br></p><p>The Director-General of SSNIT, Kwesi Afreh Biney, said protecting the value of pensions remained a core responsibility of the Trust.</p><p><br></p><p>He noted that with inflation standing at 5.4 per cent as of December last year, the adjustment ensured that pensioners’ incomes were protected against rising prices.</p><p><br></p><p>“What that means is that every pensioner on our payroll pension payments at least has been covered for inflation. Because even for the highest pensioner, it’s about 6%,” he said.</p><p><br></p><p>Mr Biney added that lower-income pensioners benefited even more significantly from the adjustment.</p><p><br></p><p>“For those on a lower rate, they have gone as high as 36.52%. That’s a testament to our commitment to ensure equity, fairness, and to protect those at the lower level. You realise that over 70% of our members are above 10%. What that means is that at an inflation rate of 5.4%, basically, the real growth for each of those factoring inflation is in excess of 5%,” he said.</p>"

And I think President Mahama is in the unique position to do the reforms I am calling for.\n\n“So far, I have not seen much. I have yet to see any clear change. If you look at the big items in our expenditure profile, the wage bill and interest payments, what are the policy positions or the changes the government is pursuing on these lines? If we cannot discuss clear changes, then it is very much business as usual,\" he said.\n\nKwarteng urged the president to make such decisions, no matter how tough, since he would not be vying for a reelection once his tenure is over.\n\n“I take this opportunity to speak to the president and to say, ‘You are not coming back; please deploy the hard decisions that this country has been needing for so long',” he said.\n\nID/AE</p>"

Semenyo will wear the number 42 shirt at the Etihad and expressed optimism during the contract signing.\n\nAlthough Semenyo had a £65 million release clause, City struck an agreement with Bournemouth worth £62.5 million, with a further £1.5 million in performance-related bonuses and a 10 percent sell-on clause included.\n\nWhile the guaranteed part of the release clause was £60 million, Bournemouth will actually receive slightly more, with the £62.5 million paid in 24 monthly instalments.\n\nSB/AE\n\nWatch as Accra Mayor shares memories of late Toure Mahama</p>"

The project aligns with national efforts under Feed Ghana and Nkoko Nkitinkiti to boost domestic poultry production, generate jobs, stabilize prices, and improve food security,” Prof Opoku-Agyemang stated in a Facebook post.\n\nGovernment distributes 720,000 birds under Nkoko Nkitinkiti programme\n\nShe noted that the project aligns with the government’s broader agricultural agenda, particularly the Feed Ghana and “Nkokonkitinkiti” programmes, which are aimed at boosting domestic poultry production and reducing the country’s heavy dependence on imported poultry products.\n\n“This initiative aligns directly with our national objectives under the Feed Ghana and ‘Nkokonkitinkiti’ to strengthen domestic poultry production and, significantly, reduce reliance on imports by 2028,” she added.\n\n\n\nThe Gomoa Pomadze Poultry Project is expected to create jobs, support local farmers, and contribute to stabilising poultry prices while enhancing Ghana’s self-sufficiency in poultry production.\n\nAside from agriculture, Vice President Prof Opoku-Agyemang cited government investments in other sectors in the town, noting them as examples of 'humanity in action.'\n\n\"Beyond agriculture, I acknowledged the community’s significant investments in education, healthcare, and humanitarian service, including the important role played by the Lajna Imaillah, the women's wing. These efforts exemplify service to humanity in action,\" she added.\n\nSee the full post below:\n\n\n\nID/AE</p>"

      "content": "<p>There was a time when tuning into a talk show felt like entering a civic space, a place for ideas to be tested, perspectives to be weighed, and disagreements to be managed with a sense of responsibility. Today, that space increasingly sounds like a battlefield. You don’t listen anymore; you endure.</p><p><br></p><p>What we’re seeing is a shift from dialogue to performance. Many presenters and guests now equate shouting with authority,passion, relevance, or “winning” an argument.</p><p><br></p><p>The volume rises within minutes. A presenter interrupts not to clarify but to overpower. Guests compete, not on the strength of facts or logic, but on who can speak the loudest and longest. Shouting has become the currency of relevance, and silence once a sign of thoughtfulness is&nbsp;treated as weakness.Somewhere along the line, conversation was mistaken for combat.</p><p><br></p><p>The tragedy is not merely the noise; it is what the noise replaces. Nuance collapses under raised voices. Evidence is drowned out by emotion. Complex national issues are flattened into verbal wrestling matches, where winning the moment matters more than enlightening the audience. The listener, caught in the crossfire, is left fatigued and frustrated.</p><p><br></p><p>Ironically, the very platforms meant to inform and educate now risk alienating the thoughtful public they were created to serve.</p><p><br></p><p>This culture did not emerge by accident. In an era where attention is scarce and outrage travels faster than reason, broadcasters have learned that noise trends better than nuance. Shouting clips circulate easily on social media. Calm, measured analysis does not. Over time, volume has been misread as passion, and aggression as authenticity.</p><p><br></p><p>But passion does not require shouting. Authority does not demand intimidation.</p><p><br></p><p>The most effective communicators in history, statesmen, jurists, negotiators understood the power of restraint. They knew that control of tone signals confidence, not weakness. That listening can be more persuasive than speaking. That clarity is louder than noise.</p><p><br></p><p>What makes the current moment particularly troubling is the collapse of moderation. Presenters, once custodians of balance and order, now often join the fray. The referee becomes a striker. Rules dissolve. Turn-taking disappears. The programme ceases to be a conversation and becomes a contest. And in contests without rules, everyone loses.</p><p><br></p><p>For public discourse, the consequences are profound. When shouting becomes normalized, aggression becomes acceptable. Viewers internalize the idea that to be heard, one must dominate. That civility is optional. That facts are secondary to force. This does not merely damage individual programmes; it erodes trust in media institutions themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Reputation, after all, is built on credibility. And credibility cannot survive perpetual chaos. The audience notices. You hear it in the sigh before the radio is switched off, see it in the quiet migration to podcasts and platforms where voices are calmer and arguments are structured. People are not disengaging from issues they are disengaging from the noise surrounding them.</p><p><br></p><p>Good broadcasting was never meant to be loud. It was meant to be clear.</p><p><br></p><p>It demands firm moderation, not theatrical confrontation. It requires discipline, time limits enforced, interruptions checked, and facts challenged. Most of all, it requires respect: for guests, for differing opinions, and for an audience that deserves more than a shouting match disguised as analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>There is still room to recover that tradition. To remind ourselves that the power of media lies not in decibels, but in discernment. Not in who shouts last, but in who speaks with purpose. Until then, many will keep lowering the volume not just on their devices, but on the very public conversations that shape our society.</p><p><br></p><p>And that silence should worry us more than any shout ever could.</p><p><br></p><p>By Samuel Awuni</p><p>Communications Expert&nbsp;</p><p>Sammi.awuni@yahoo.co.uk</p><p><br></p>"

Further checks revealed that the task force consisted of&nbsp;‘boys’&nbsp;allegedly associated with the MP<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;not NAIMOS personnel.</p><p><br></p><p>The raid targeted&nbsp;galamsey&nbsp;sites in&nbsp;Afodowa,&nbsp;Nyamedema, and surrounding areas<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;all within the&nbsp;Aowin&nbsp;municipality. According to the MCE, the&nbsp;Enchi&nbsp;Divisional Police Command was unable to respond immediately&nbsp;because its officers were engaged in monitoring a land dispute within the municipality's boundaries. He therefore instructed military personnel, guided by his driver, to reach the&nbsp;galamsey&nbsp;sites and apprehend all individuals involved.</p><p><br></p><p>Per information received by&nbsp;the MCE, the illegal task force were reportedly extorting money from&nbsp;galamsey&nbsp;operators during the operation. Hon.&nbsp;Morcher&nbsp;further revealed that the boys allegedly associated with the MP had&nbsp;extorted 20,000 Ghana&nbsp;cedis&nbsp;and a piece of gold, as reported and captured on video by one of the victims.</p><p>He confirmed that&nbsp;the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>task force members were apprehended and handed over to the&nbsp;EnchiDivisional Police Command, and that the police are currently investigating the matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Hon.&nbsp;Morcher&nbsp;emphasised&nbsp;that&nbsp;only the municipal assembly has the authority to constitute task forces<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;making the MP’s unilateral action illegal. “An MP cannot unilaterally form a task force without notifying the Assembly,” he said.</p><p><br></p><p>Hon.&nbsp;Morcher&nbsp;reiterated his commitment to&nbsp;fighting illegal mining and ensuring accountability,&nbsp;emphasising&nbsp;that the municipality, with the support of national security and military personnel, remains steadfast in curbing&nbsp;galamsey&nbsp;activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

In other words, as cedi liquidity was withdrawn from the system, pressure on the foreign exchange market eased and the currency strengthened.</p><p>He stated that the contraction of the cedi liquidity reduced private demand for foreign exchange, reinforcing disinflation and driving the observed shift cedi depreciation to appreciation.</p><p>“In the long run, exchange rates are governed by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and the Quantity Theory of Money, where relative money supplies and inflation differentials determine currency values. Given Ghana’s history of volatile inflation, the long-run framework is particularly instructive”, Dr. Nsafoah who is an Assistant Professor of Economics at Niagara University, New York, pointed out.</p><p>He further stated that if inflation in Ghana falls relative to inflation in the United States according to PPP, the cedi should appreciate. Under the Quantity Theory of Money, this disinflation is achieved by reducing the growth of money in circulation. “This is exactly what occurred in 2025”.</p><p>The Experience of 2025 Delivers a Powerful Message</p><p>Continuing, Dr. Nsafoah, who is a Member of the Research Committee, Tesah Capital, said many factors influence inflation and exchange rates, but monetary policy remains the decisive force. “The Bank of Ghana’s actions — tightening liquidity, anchoring expectations, and allowing monetary conditions to bite — were central to Ghana’s macroeconomic stabilisation”.</p><p>Finally, he stressed that if one is looking for an early warning signal of whether — and when — the exchange rate may return to episodes of sharp and disorderly depreciation, the key variable to monitor is not external shocks or speculative narratives, but a policy variable fully under the control of the Bank of Ghana.</p><p>He concluded that the experience of 2025 shows that exchange rate stability coincided with the contraction or modest growth of bank reserves at the central bank.</p><p>Therefore, as long as reserves held with the Bank of Ghana are shrinking or growing only moderately, pressure on the foreign exchange market remains contained.</p><p>“However, if the growth rate of these reserves were to reverse course —returning to the 50 percent to triple-digit annual growth rates observed in earlier years — this would signal a renewed surge in cedi liquidity. History suggests that such an expansion would quickly translate into excess demand for foreign currency and a renewed phase of sharp cedi depreciation”, he added.</p>"

      "content": "<p>In Ghana, women in various fields have consistently fought for their integrity and excelled in their professions.\n\nOver the years, the nation has celebrated the achievements of courageous women who, through resilience and determination, have risen to hold distinguished positions.\n\nOne such trailblazer is Justice Annie Jiagge, who made history as Ghana’s first woman lawyer and who also became the first woman High Court judge in the entire Commonwealth. \n\nHer groundbreaking accomplishments continue to inspire generations of women to pursue excellence and leadership.\n\nAccording to a report by GhanaWeb in 2023, if Ghana can boast of great and astute female legal practitioners, then it is due to the strides by women like Justice Anne Jiagge who shattered the glass and opened the door of opportunity for young Ghanaian girls to dream of becoming lawyers and judges.\n\nIn an era where the law profession was reserved for men, Anne Jiagge embarked on a mission to do the unthinkable, and her determination paid off as her record is decorated with achievements like first Ghanaian female lawyer, first Ghanaian female judge, the first Ghanaian High Court judge and most profoundly first woman in any Commonwealth Country to be appointed a High Court judge.\n\nFor context, Ghana had a female High Court judge before countries like England, Australia, and Canada. Such is the magnitude of achievement of Anne Jiagge who clearly deserves much more recognition than she is given.\n\nA publication by UK-based law portal gatehouselaw.co.uk in celebration of her marvellous works details that Anne Jiagge was born as Anne Ruth Baeta in French Togoland on October 7, 1918.\n\nAccording to braperucci.africa, Anne Jiagge's father was a Presbyterian priest by name of Robert Baeta who had eight children with his wife.\n\nShe attended Achimota College where she obtained a teaching certificate in 1937. From 1940 to 1946, she was headmistress and schoolteacher at the Evangelical Presbyterian Girls School.\n\nHer successful foray into the legal profession commenced in 1946 when she enrolled at the London School of Economics and Political Science to study law.\n\nShe graduated from the school with flying colours and received her LLB in 1949, she was subsequently called to the UK Bar.\n\nShe returned to Ghana (then Gold Coast) in 1950 and set up her private firm which she operated for three years.\n\nShe dropped the bar for the bench in 1953 and began as a magistrate. From there, she worked her way up and became Ghana's first female High Court judge in September 1961.\n\nAnnie was the first female judge of the Court of Appeal. She later became president of the Court of Appeal in 1980 until her retirement in 1983.\n\nShe played a great role in the drafting of Ghana's 3rd and 4th Republican constitutions, serving on the committee of experts who put together the documents.\n\nUntil her demise in 1996, she was a member of the Council of State.\n\nThis article was first published by GhanaWeb on Saturday, December 28, 2019\n\nVKB/AE</p>"

Semenyo is the third top scorer in the league with 10 goals, plus he has three assists.</p><p><br></p><p>He has a shot accuracy of 55% this season, the second highest of anyone who has scored five or more in the Premier League, and his 22 goal involvements in the calendar year is the most in the Premier League by a Bournemouth player ever.</p><p><br></p><p>Plus, his style of play would offer a new dimension to a City side whose bid to catch Premier League leaders Arsenal has faltered with three consecutive draws.</p><p><br></p><p>Consummately two-footed, only Erling Haaland and Jean-Phillipe Mateta have attempted more shots than Semenyo this campaign (excluding blocked shots), while his total of 76 attempted dribbles is the fourth-highest total in the top flight.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He can drive forward with the ball vertically, rather than Doku who comes in and out,\" former England goalkeeper Rob Green told BBC 5 Live.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He can do that something different Pep is looking for. Short term they have their own injury problems, so he can help short term and long term.</p><p><br></p><p>\"It does raise the question what future someone like Savinho has though.\"</p><p><br></p><p>The Afcon issue is no problem for Semenyo, with Ghana having surprisingly failed to qualify.</p><p><br></p><p>And Guardiola was already confirmed as a fan of him earlier this season, before the transfer talk intensified.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He's an extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinary player,\" the Spaniard insisted.</p><p><br></p><p>\"His energy, his confidence, his movement - unbelievable. He doesn't stop running, he attacks space so well, and when he has the ball, you feel something will happen.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He's improving every game. Players like him make this league special - always hungry, always brave.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Semenyo's output backs up the bombast. Only City striker Erling Haaland and Brentford forward Igor Thiago have been involved in more Premier League goals this season.</p><p><br></p><p>\"He's a brilliant, brilliant player,\" former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Match of the Day. \"At 25, he is in the peak of his career as well.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Manchester City spent vast sums last January because of an injury crisis and have added big-money signing Semenyo this time around in very different circumstances.</p><p><br></p><p>City are chasing Arsenal in the Premier League title race, one of four fronts both teams are competing on, and Guardiola has decided to strengthen the right-hand side of his attack.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ghana international offers pace and direct running from that flank, and it will be of great satisfaction to Guardiola that he chose City over the other options he had.</p><p><br></p><p>But one in means one may now leave, with Savinho or Oscar Bobb possibly being moved on to accommodate him.</p>"

While processing factories reportedly employ fewer than 1,000 workers nationwide, the farmers noted that rubber farming and trading sustain the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, including tappers, carriers, loaders, farm maintenance workers and transport operators.</p><p>“In total, over two million dependents rely on incomes generated from rubber farming activities,” the petition stated, warning that lower farm-gate prices could deepen rural poverty and push more youth into illegal mining.</p><p>Disputing Revenue Loss Claims</p><p>The farmers also questioned claims that Ghana loses up to US$100 million annually due to raw rubber exports.</p><p>They insist exporters comply with statutory levies payable to TCDA, while alleging that some processing companies themselves are not fully complying with levy payments, contrary to claims of supporting government revenue mobilisation.</p><p>Limited Value Addition in Ghana</p><p>RUFAG further argued that Ghana currently lacks advanced rubber processing factories, noting that most local processors only convert rubber cup lumps into Technically Specified Rubber (TSR), which remains a primary commodity for export.</p><p>After decades of operation, the farmers say Ghana is yet to see significant production of finished rubber products such as tyres, gloves or medical supplies, questioning the industrialisation argument being advanced.</p><p>COVID-19 LessonsThe farmers recalled that during the COVID-19 pandemic, several processors suspended purchases, leaving farmers stranded, while exporters provided alternative markets that helped sustain livelihoods.“This experience shows that multiple markets offer security to farmers and prevent unnecessary hardship,” the petition noted.</p><p>No Illegality in Exports Farmers Insist</p><p>The group dismissed assertions that raw rubber exports violate Act 1010 or L.I. 2471, insisting that the laws do not prohibit exports but rather empower TCDA to regulate them through a permit system.</p><p>They warned that allegations of illegality without credible evidence could undermine investor confidence and weaken trust in regulatory institutions.</p><p>Disassociation from ANRAGIn the petition, the farmers formally dissociated themselves from the Association of Natural Rubber Actors of Ghana (ANRAG), describing it as a processor-driven group that does not represent the interests of the wider rubber value chain.</p><p>They urged government and policymakers to engage broadly with all legitimate stakeholders before taking decisions that affect the industry.</p><p>Regional Minister Responds</p><p>Receiving the petition, Western Regional Minister Joseph Nelson commended the demonstrators for their peaceful conduct and assured them their concerns would be forwarded to the appropriate authorities, including the President of the Republic of Ghana.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Legal counsel for embattled former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, Frank Davies, has given details on the detention of his client by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nAccording to a report by myjoyonline.com, Ofori-Atta’s lawyer affirmed that his client ended up in the custody of ICE because of issues relating to his visa.\n\nHe indicated that the former finance minister's visa was set to expire on February 14, 2025, and he has started the process to get it extended.\n\nHe said that Ofori-Atta needs his visa extended so that he can continue seeking medical attention that took him to the US in the first place, adding that the American authorities would soon determine whether his application is justified.\n\n\"Ken Ofori-Atta left here, and then he gave notice that he was going for a medical procedure that had been done. And if we all know what he's suffering from, it is not easy. After that, he has to go through a period of recuperation.\n\n\"And that is exactly what he is doing. He is in constant consultation with his medical team, and if they advise that at the stage at which they are, it is imperative for him to continue to remain in the States so that they can attend to him, what exactly is wrong with that?\" the lawyer is quoted to have said.\n\nHe added, \"If you visit a country and, for some reason, are unable to leave when you are supposed to, you apply to extend your stay. What is so strange about that? Yes, he has applied for an extension, and the petition is with ICE. They will determine it, and in the fullness of time, we will all know whether the petition has merit or not.”\n\nKen Ofori-Atta arrested and detained in the US\n\nFrank Davies refuted assertions that there was something wrong with the move to get his client’s visa extended, saying the application is a routine immigration process.\n\n“This is a normal practice in every jurisdiction. If someone is unable to leave a country when their visa expires due to unforeseen circumstances, they apply for an extension,” he said.\n\nOfori-Atta’s American lawyers issued a public notice on his detention by ICE on January 8, 2025.\n\nOfori-Atta is a suspect in multiple criminal investigations by Ghana’s Office of the Special Prosecutor, which declared him wanted and placed him on an Interpol Red Notice.\n\nSee details of the US ICE facility where Ken Ofori-Atta is being held\n\nBelow are the cases the OSP has declared Ofori-Atta wanted for:\n\n1. Contractual arrangements between Strategic Mobilisation Ghana Limited and the Ghana Revenue Authority, aimed at enhancing revenue assurance in the downstream petroleum sector, upstream petroleum production, and the minerals and metals resources value chain.\n\n2. Termination of a contract between the Electricity Company of Ghana Limited and Beijing Xiao Cheng Technology (BXC) for the Distribution, Loss Reduction, and Associated Network Improvement Project.\n\n3. Procurement of contractors, materials, and payments related to the National Cathedral project.\n\n4. Activities and payments associated with a contract awarded by the Ministry of Health (initially commenced by the Ministry for Special Development Initiatives) to Service Ghana Auto Group Limited for the purchase and after-sales service and maintenance of 307 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 305 CDI ambulances for the National Ambulance Service.\n\n5. Payments and utilisation of funds from the Tax Refund Account of the Ghana Revenue Authority.\n\nBAI\n\nYou can also watch more videos from Naser Toure's funeral below:</p>"

      "content": "<p>The macroeconomic stability Ghana is currently experiencing is driven more by the IMF programme than by any exceptional policy brilliance of the government, Walewale MP Dr Tia Kabiru has argued.</p><p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, the NPP lawmaker said while the economy has recorded some gains, those outcomes are neither new nor unique in the life of a first-term government.</p><p>“To be blunt, the economy has achieved some successes to that extent, you will give credit to the managers of the economy. But is it novel? Is it the case that it has never been done in any first year of a government? And the answer is no,” he said.</p><p>Dr Kabiru cautioned against what he described as an exaggerated narrative about current economic performance, insisting that similar, and in some cases stronger, indicators had been recorded in the past under IMF-supported programmes.</p><p>He pointed to the period between 2017 and 2019, noting that Ghana experienced growth, primary budget surpluses, and positive macroeconomic indicators, all under IMF arrangements.</p><p>“In 2017, we had similar euphoria around the first budget. We had growth that was far in excess of what we are experiencing now. We had a primary budget surplus and all the positive indicators. But we have to also know that in all these years, we had IMF-supported programmes,” he said.</p><p>He warned against creating the impression that Ghana’s current stability is unprecedented.</p><p>“Whilst we give credit, let us not create a sense that this is the first time, in a government’s first year in office, that we are having this kind of result,” he added.</p><p>Dr Kabiru compared public sentiment then and now, citing approval ratings to reinforce his argument.</p><p>“The euphoria around the 2017 budget, and the outcome of that budget, with the greatest respect, was far more than what we are experiencing. Approval rating for the president at the end of his first year, according to Afrobarometer, was 70 per cent. Here we are having 67 per cent,” he said.</p><p>Despite his criticism, he said he was not dismissing the gains entirely.</p><p>“That notwithstanding, I do not want to diminish the impact, the growth, the macroeconomic and price stability that we are experiencing,” he said.</p><p>However, he insisted that any honest assessment must place the IMF programme at the centre of the recovery.</p><p>“If anyone wants to say that anything has contributed to this without first acknowledging the IMF-supported programme we have, which has served as an anchor, which is the big man in the house driving whatever we do, then I disagree,” he said.</p><p>He argued that without the programme, Ghana could easily slide back into fiscal indiscipline.</p><p>“But for the programme, we may have to see some government fiscal indiscipline,” he added.</p><p>Dr Kabiru said the President and the Finance Minister deserve credit for sticking to the programme, but not for portraying the recovery as entirely home-grown.</p><p>“The fact that the President and the Finance Minister have committed to the programme is worthy of commendation. But for me, we should not create a sense that it is the first time it’s happening,” he said.</p><p>He also stressed that the recovery should be viewed cautiously.</p><p>“We should only hope and pray that it is sustainable. We shouldn’t be looking at the recovery as something that we should celebrate over,” he said.</p><p>Dr Kabiru said some credit must also go to the previous government, which initiated the IMF programme now anchoring the economy.</p><p>“There is a programme that the previous government initiated that the previous government must actually also take some of the credit for,” he said.</p><p>Ultimately, he argued that the true test of the economy lies ahead.</p><p>“Let’s see how we move into the second and third year. If the government should put in the third year, then we would know the true state of the economy, and whether or not the commendation we are giving now should be temporary or permanent,” he added.</p>"

The rapper questioned the basis of the arrest, suggesting that Ebo Noah’s actions had been misunderstood.</p><p>“Don’t know exactly what my boy’s crime is, but from day one I knew he was making content, unless he’s been charged with something else,” Sarkodie wrote, casting doubt on the seriousness of Ebo Noah’s widely publicised prophecy.</p><p>Ebo Noah was arrested on Wednesday, December 31, 2025, by the Ghana Police Service after months of nationwide anxiety sparked by his prediction of a catastrophic flood scheduled for December 25, 2025. The prophecy, which drew comparisons to the biblical story of Noah, claimed that a three-year global flood would begin on Christmas Day.</p><p>The 33-year-old content creator gained viral attention in late 2025 by documenting himself on TikTok and YouTube as he built wooden “arks” in places such as Elmina and Kumasi. He claimed the vessels were meant to save believers and said he was building up to 10 of them on divine instruction.</p><p>When no flood occurred on December 25, Ebo Noah told followers that his prayers and fasting had convinced God to postpone the disaster, a claim that further fuelled public backlash.</p><p>Outrage intensified after he appeared on stage at Sarkodie’s Rapperholic 2025 concert on December 25—the same day the predicted flood was expected to begin.</p><p>Police later arrested him in the Weija-Gbawe area for allegedly spreading false news and causing fear and panic. On January 2, 2026, the Adentan Circuit Court remanded him into police custody for two weeks and ordered a psychiatric evaluation at the Pantang Psychiatric Hospital.</p><p>Ebo Noah is expected to reappear in court on January 16, 2026.</p>"

This proportion marks a decline compared to the corresponding period in 2024, when the UK corridor contributed 27.6 percent, equivalent to more than one quarter of total inflows,” he said.</p><p>London–Accra Economic Growth Summit was officially launched in July 2025 with the Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, as part of a campaign to strengthen economic cooperation between Ghana and the United Kingdom through meaningful diaspora engagement.</p><p>Dr. Asiama also stated that there is considerable scope to scale up remittance inflows from the UK through the implementation of well-targeted policy measures and incentive-based frameworks adding that Diaspora inflows must be harnessed beyond consumption and deliberately channeled into sustainable investment that drives long-term growth.</p><p>The flows, he explained, have played a vital role in supporting household consumption, strengthened balance of payments, and enhanced macroeconomic stability.</p><p>“However, beyond consumption, remittances hold even greater potential as a driver of productive investment. When strategically channelled, they can finance small and medium-sized enterprises expand housing, modernise agriculture and, in doing so, create sustainable employment for young people through knowledge and skills transfer programmes at the national and local levels,” he noted.</p><p>The Governor mentioned that the Central Bank will soon roll out many targeted interventions including the development of the National Remittance Strategy in close collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, as well as a Remittance Road show to advance inclusive, continent-wide engagement with diasporans.</p><p>“I am calling on all stakeholders, including development partners and our diaspora leaders – let’s work together deliberately and decisively to transform remittances from simple transfers into powerful engines of growth, resilience and shared prosperity”.</p><p>“By deepening our markets, strengthening our institutions, and mobilising diaspora capital through credible and transparent frameworks, we can build a more resilient, investment-driven future for Ghana,” he emphasised.</p><p>By Ebenezer K, Amponsah</p>"

      "content": "<p>The country’s downward inflation trend continued its steady decline in December 2025, falling to 5.4 percent year on year, new data from the Ghana Statistical Service has shown.</p><p>The decline marks the 12th consecutive month of disinflation and the lowest rate since the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was rebased in 2021.</p><p>Government Statistician, Dr. Alhassan Iddrisu, presenting the latest inflation figures in Accra, yesterday, said the CPI for December 2025 stood at 261.7, up from 240.8 in December 2024, translating into a significant moderation in price pressures over the year.</p><p>This he said meant that, on average, goods and services cost 5.4 percent more than they did in December 2024.</p><p>“This result is significant because inflation has now declined for 12 consecutive months. It fell from 6.3 percent in November 2025 and from 23.8 percent in December 2024, representing a reduction of 18.4 percentage points within a year,” he explained.</p><p>Dr. Iddrisu further noted that the sustained decline, points to improving macroeconomic conditions and a firm shift towards price stability.</p><p>On a month-on-month basis, inflation stood at 0.9 percent in December 2025, indicating a marginal increase in prices between November and December with Dr. Iddrisu explaining that while short-term price movements persist, they are now occurring within a stable and downward long-term trend.</p><p>Dr. Iddrisu said price pressures eased across food, non-food, goods, and both locally produced and imported items, compared to both November 2025 and December 2024.</p><p>Food inflation also recorded a sharp decline on an annual basis, falling to 4.9 percent in December 2025, down from 6.6 percent in November 2025 and 27.8 percent in December 2024, representing a 22.9 percentage point drop over the year.</p><p>“This matters because food accounts for about 43 percent of household spending. Lower food inflation directly eases pressure on household budgets,” Dr. Iddrisu noted.</p><p>However, he cautioned that food prices still rose by 1.1 percent month on month, suggesting that while long-term pressures have eased, short-term fluctuations remain, largely driven by seasonal factors.</p><p>Non-food inflation also declined significantly, easing to 5.8 percent in December, from 6.1 percent in November and 20.3 percent a year earlier, reflecting a 14.5 percentage point reduction over the year. On a monthly basis, non-food prices increased by 0.6 percent, indicating moderate pressure.</p><p>“These trends show broad-based disinflation across both food and non-food categories, rather than improvements driven by a single component,” Dr. Iddrisu said.</p><p>The data also revealed a strong slowdown in goods inflation, which fell to 5.8 percent in December 2025, down from 7.3 percent in November and 23.1 percent in December 2024. This represents a 17.3 percentage point reduction over the year.</p><p>“Goods account for nearly three-quarters of the CPI basket, so this slowdown provides relief where it matters most to consumers,” he said.</p><p>Goods prices increased by 0.8 percent month on month, while services inflation edged up slightly to 4.5 percent in December, from 3.8 percent in November. Despite the increase, services inflation remains well below its 15.4 percent level in December 2024, marking a 10.9 percentage point decline over the year.</p><p>Month-on-month, services prices rose by 0.9 percent between November and December 2025.</p><p>A Business Desk Report</p>"

The $214 million loss is from GoldBod’s trading activities. But there is another leg of the loss that will show up in the BoG’s audited accounts, and it will be higher,” he said.</p><p>Dr. Boako explained that the additional losses stem from the Bank of Ghana’s cedi–dollar–gold operations. He criticised the current regime, under which the central bank collects cedis from commercial banks to purchase gold at Bloomberg rates, only to hold the resulting gold at an artificially lower rate, before selling dollars at the Bank’s official rate.</p><p>He attributed this new loss to six additional tonnes of gold currently held in the Bank of Ghana vault. “Because the Bank is operating a multiple exchange rate system—a practice the IMF has criticised—it buys the reserve gold at a higher Bloomberg rate but values it in its accounts at about 10 percent lower. This creates exchange losses when the audit is conducted,” he explained.</p><p>“The IMF report has stated that this is not sustainable and will continue to cause further losses,” Dr. Boako added.</p><p>He concluded that the emerging figures reflect structural policy issues rather than flaws in GoldBod’s operational design. According to Dr. Boako, without adjustments to the exchange rate regime, additional financial strain on the Bank of Ghana and GoldBod is inevitable.</p>"

Ideally, this citadel should be a fortress insulated from the strings and arrows of the political warfare. Whatever it is, we should think twice before we do anything that has the capacity to cast a snare on the integrity of the bank,” the Otumfuo said.</p><p>“I will appeal to the nation and both sides of the political divide to give the Governor, my son and his team a chance, give them the space and respect to perform their professional duties. Support them along the right path and offer counsel necessary for the good of the Bank. This is our bank, we have entrusted to them, if they fail, we risk collapse, if they succeed, we walk in wealth and in glory,” the Asantehene noted.</p><p>The visit was intended to offer Otumfuo Osei Tutu II a firsthand understanding of BoG’s role in stabilising the economy, ensuring price stability, and protecting the country’s financial system.</p><p>While commending the management of the Central Bank for various policies that has helped transformed the economy, the Asantehene also encouraged the Bank of Ghana to continue to communicate in a language that resonates with the public while explaining policies in simple terms that all Ghanaians would understand.</p><p>“It is a fact of history that when the currency is healthy, the economy bristles with opportunities, the people are able to use the opportunities to create business the business allows the people to create jobs and ultimately walk in wealth, when the Cedi wobbles even the Tsunami can be less destructive,” the Asantehene noted.</p><p>Reflecting on the past year, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II  stated that though the cedi has shown signs of stabilisation after a challenging period, it should be recognised as an early sign of progress that need not to be celebrated before the full scope of the harvest while acknowledging and urging the Central Bank to maintain the trajectory.</p><p>The Asantehene further asked the leadership of the Bank of Ghana to focus on transitioning the economy from high interest rates to a more favorable environment that promotes business and wealth creation.</p><p>“No amount of foreign investment can solve our economic challenges unless we address the crippling high interest rates,” he stated. He called for a massive push to stimulate domestic private investment and industry, which he said cannot thrive under current interest rate levels.</p><p>Governor of the Bank of Ghana, Dr. Johnson Asiama for his part assured Ghanaians that the Central Bank is committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening monetary discipline, and restoring confidence in the financial sector while acknowledging the challenges facing the country.</p><p>By Ebenezer K.

The last time such brutish conduct took place was in Tamale when a student of the Tamale Technical University was assaulted by a policeman during a students’ demonstration.</p><p>In any case, firefighters are not known to behave like hounds or hogs as they did at Kasoa.</p><p>If the misconduct of the first responders at the fire scene disheartened Ghanaians, the response from the Public Relations (PR) Unit of the GNFS did worst bereft of wisdom. Whoever crafted the response did so without an idea of how to manage image crisis.</p><p>Claiming that the defaulting personnel were assaulting a thief opens the GNFS for further public opprobrium. Must a suspected thief be hit on the head with protective helmets the way the viral video showed on social media? Was that how the defaulters were trained at the Fire Training School? Is that nonsense part of firefighting drill? And the PR Unit put out that ‘crap’ of a response without the Chief Fire Officer reading it before letting out on the public domain?</p><p>It is instructive that even before assaulting the poor Class FM reporter, the firefighters had already been engaged in an altercation with some persons around the fire scene. It just shows that a bunch of undisciplined firefighters were deployed to the fire scene, leaving us to deal with the rotten outcome.</p><p>We find it amazing that after defending the action of the personnel, the GNFS turns round to tell us that they are investigating the misconduct.</p><p>There was nothing wrong with videoing the misconduct of the defaulters by the reporter, which incensed the first responders. If the misconduct is acceptable, why were the defaulters scared of the public having a look at what transpired anyway.</p><p>Let us not allow a situation where when firefighters respond to an emergency they turn their hoses and helmets on victims and others as tools of assault rather than tools for putting fires and saving lives and properties.</p><p>While we do not have confidence in the outcome of the enquiry being conducted by management of the GNFS, we nonetheless demand that an apology be rendered to Ghanaians even before the report is released.</p>"
