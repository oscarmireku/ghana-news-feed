      "content": "<p>A 30-year-old surrogate mother has successfully delivered quadruplets at the Walking Egg Medical and Fertility Centre in Pokuase, Greater Accra Region, in what specialists describe as a rare outcome of assisted reproductive technology.</p><p>The babies, two boys and two girls, were delivered at 36 weeks through Intrauterine Insemination (IUI), a fertility treatment that involves placing processed, concentrated sperm directly into the uterus around ovulation to increase the chance of fertilization. Quadruplet births through IUI are considered extremely uncommon.</p><p>The Chief Executive Officer of the centre, Dr Nana Yaw Osei, who performed the delivery, explained that, unlike In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), doctors have no control over how many embryos implant during IUI.</p><p>Despite the high-risk nature of carrying four foetuses, Dr Osei described the pregnancy as smooth, with no major complications. He noted that the delivery was done as a precautionary measure and that all four babies were assessed by paediatricians and found to be healthy, each weighing over two kilogrammes. He also disclosed that foetal reduction was discussed but was ultimately ruled out based on ethical and religious considerations.</p><p>“As a strong Christian, I consider foetal reduction equivalent to abortion. My team, the intended parents, and the surrogate all agreed to continue with all four foetuses. It was a very special moment,” he said.</p><p>Explaining the medical uniqueness of the case, Dr Osei noted that IUI relies entirely on natural implantation.</p><p>“With IUI, you only prepare the sperm and introduce it into the womb. You cannot control how many embryos implant. That is what makes this case so rare and remarkable,” he explained.</p><p>Touching on the cultural context of assisted reproduction in Ghana, Dr Osei said surrogacy remains an emerging practice, with most surrogates being independent women who volunteer primarily for financial reasons. He added that the centre requires surrogates to have at least one child of their own before participating, to minimise risks.</p><p>Reflecting on the broader impact of fertility care, Dr Osei recalled cases of women who had lost their wombs but still desired children.\n“Should we deny such women the opportunity to experience parenthood? Assisted reproduction offers hope to families who would otherwise never have children,” he said.</p><p>He stressed that both donors and surrogates are kept anonymous to protect privacy and dignity.</p><p>“Our aim is to combine medical expertise with ethical and culturally sensitive practices. This successful quadruplet delivery demonstrates the potential of assisted reproductive technology in Ghana and offers hope to couples struggling with infertility,” Dr Osei added.</p><p>By Vera Owusu Sarpong</p>"

He pointed to the purchase of a luxury Toyota Land Cruiser, costing nearly US$200,000, and a US$20,000 digital printing machine shortly after the new management took office, arguing that these acquisitions were made possible from revenues and investments generated during his tenure from 2017 to 2024.</p><p>“The company consistently recorded profits, secured major contracts, and expanded operations over several years. These achievements were the result of long-term planning and strategic investments, not sudden actions by a few months of new management,” he stated.</p><p>Mr. Asante also emphasized that audited financial statements clearly reflect GPCL’s improved position and warned against attempts to rewrite the company’s history for political credit.</p><p>“GPCL’s turnaround is well documented and cannot be attributed to actions taken within a few months of the current administration,” he added.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The Ghana Audit Service has issued a surcharge against 35 contractors to pay $7.9 million (approximately GH¢94.6 million) to the state.</p><p>The amount was paid to them as mobilisation fees to execute Agenda 111 hospital projects on 19 sites. Out of the $11.16 million paid to the contractors, they together executed work valued at $5.96 million.</p><p>An additional $4.35 million was paid to 11 companies, who together executed up to $2.49 million of inception work, leaving $1.92 million of work not done before their contracts were terminated.</p><p>After receiving the various mobilisation sums paid between December 2021 and December 2024, some of the contractors (being surcharged) failed to move to the site, and others executed work less than 10 per cent of the value of the payments received.</p><p>The findings are contained in a validation review after a special audit into the Agenda 111 contracts sighted by the Daily Graphic.</p><p>The findings have compelled the Auditor-General, Johnson Akuamoah Asiedu, to invoke his constitutional powers to surcharge all 35 companies and individuals to recover the full amount.</p><p>The audit, which examined payment records and conducted physical inspections of project sites, uncovered a pattern where contractors received the standard 10 per cent of their contract sum as mobilisation, intended to fund preparatory works and expedite commencement, but delivered little to nothing in return.</p><p>Of the total amount, 24 contractors, whose contracts are still valid, are to refund $5.96 million because the work done is grossly inadequate compared to the mobilisation they received.</p><p>The report lists instances of payments for zero work. For example, at Adeiso, Imperial Homes, Grand Unique Company Limited and Terraefuoco Limited were paid $1.01 million, $81,074.40 and $130,910.19, respectively, but would have to refund every cent for executing zero work.</p><p>Similarly, Casa City Limited and Dynamic Access Limited received various sums to build a hospital at Agbogbloshie, but did no work.</p><p>The report lists other contractors to be surcharged for zero work to include 4G Building Technologies Ltd, which has to refund $1.07 million for doing two per cent of the $1.34 million mobilisation amount.</p><p>Other companies that executed no work after receiving mobilisation include Josano Limited, Asvas Company Limited, Ghire Limited, Concord Consult Limited, Delovely Company Limited, Osini Group Limited, and Noble Gen Limited.</p><p>In the terminated contracts category, Hallwort Ghana Limited, which was to build a hospital at Adabokrom, was paid $67,772.60 for no work, while Dominion Covenant Company Limited (Akrofuom) received $129,866.30, also for zero work executed, with Aarun-bis Company Limited, which was to execute a project at Bunkpurugu, carrying out no work.</p><p>One of the largest single payments for minimal work was $960,937.69 to Mendanha & Sousa, which was to build a hospital at Mankranso, carried out less than 10 per cent of the value of work before termination, leaving $375,702.30 to be refunded.</p><p>Similarly, Tk Waters Limited executed $571,112.89 of the $1.10 million of the mobilisation fee for the Nangodi hospital, leaving $530,513.11 to be refunded.</p><p>Other cases show payments massively outstripping progress. For instance, 4G Building Technologies Ltd was paid over $1.3 million, but had only achieved two per cent of work, leaving over $1 million to be refunded to the state.</p><p>Some companies, however, performed work close to the mobilisation sums received.</p><p>They include Rajar Engineering, which executed 9.8 per cent of the $937,724.53 paid for it to mobilise to Akatsi; Jaborah Construction Limited executed 9.7 per cent of the project in Akrofuom; Ark Express Ghana Limited performed nine per cent of the $129,866.30 mobilisation at Busunya, with Kofi Job Company Limited doing 8.63 per cent of the $1.43 million Bantama Sub-Metro Ampabame Agenda 111 project.</p><p>“It is recommended that the Auditor-General invoke Article 187(7)(b) and surcharge the 35 Contractors the sum to which they have been given as a refund to the state,” the report stated.</p><p>Article 187(7)(b) of the Constitution empowers the Auditor-General to disallow any item of expenditure contrary to law and to surcharge the person responsible for the illegal payment.</p><p>In an interview with the Daily Graphic, the Auditor-General said his office had issued disallowance and surcharge notices to implicated contractors.</p><p>“After 14 days, if they fail to show cause, the money becomes a debt due and owing to the state,” Mr Asiedu said.</p><p>The Agenda 111 initiative, a flagship New Patriotic Party (NPP) government programme aimed at constructing 111 hospitals to improve healthcare access nationwide, has been under public scrutiny over delays.</p>"

It did not just happen the last 8 months , that is falsehood !</p><p>Mr President I’m sure prior to your visit to the company last week , your handlers must have briefed you and made available to you , copies of the audited accounts of the company for the period 2019 to 2024, showing among others, profit and over 3,000 % increase in net assets of the company specifically for the year 2023 , amongst other remarkable and well documented successes for the company.</p><p>Furthermore, there was strategic investment into the acquisition of mordern equipment and to give the company a total facelift and make it wholly competitive.</p><p>In the over 60 years history of existence of Ghana Publishing Company Limited, no Government has managed , turned arround and invested heavily in machine acquisition and establishment of regional branches like the NPP has done in the last 8 years.</p><p>This is the reason major state institutions and private clients from 2020 found the company properly technically positioned for the execution of sensitive assignments like the printing of ballot papers for National Elections, a right the company had lost previously.</p><p>Significantly, a new branch was established in Kumasi for the first time in the over 60 years history of Ghana Publishing company limited , NDC didn’t do this and can not on any day be seen clamoring for the credit for it</p><p>As a result of these joint concerted efforts the company raked in millions of Ghana Cedis in profit every quarter as its IGF.</p><p>I wish to take this opportunity to set the records straight on a number of falsehoods been peddled around:</p><p>1. As far back as 2019 , after the inauguration of the new production unit with an ultra mordern 5 color machine and a computer to plate ( CTP ) machine ,the company started a 24 hour production, the company printed 5 regions for the 2020 presidential and parliamentary elections ballot papers under 24 hour production , and also printed for the 2024 Presidential and Parliamentary elections , It is instructive to note that Payment for this work – Miliions of Cedis was made by the EC after the new management had taken over.</p><p>2. Parliament of Ghana also made payment of money owed the company for over 5 years of work executed by the Ghana Publishing company, after the new management had taken over.</p><p>3. The newly established Kumasi branch rakes In millions of Ghana Cedis into the company accounts on a monthly basis , enough to take care of the company’s wage bill every month.</p><p>The revenue from the above-listed payments , other outstanding creditors and investments should represent more than 15 million ghana cedis the new management claims to have saved for the company</p><p>The NDC government has no moral right to seek to take credit for the transformation of the Ghana Publishing Company. Indeed, if the company was in such a bad state of affairs financially, the new management could not have afforded to buy a brand new Toyota Landcruser at almost $200,000 for the MDs office and an almost $20,000 digital machine for the company, in less than 4 months .</p><p>The transformation of Ghana Publishing Company Ltd under the NPP government is incontrovertible and is captured in the audited accounts as well as videos and images.

      "content": "<p>The Minister of State in charge of Government Communications, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, took his turn to brief the public at the Government Accountability Series on Wednesday, January 14, 2026.\n\nAs expected, the minister was asked questions on the economy, state prosecution, and the detention of former Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, in the United States, among others.\n\nHere are some of the key issues the minister touched on:\n\nPetitions for the removal of Special Prosecutor, and the EC leadership:\n\nThe minister, while answering a question on petitions for the removal of the Special Prosecutor, and the leadership of the Electoral Commission of Ghana (EC), confirmed that ten petitions had been submitted so far.\n\nHe said that petitions had so far been submitted to the Chief Justice, in accordance with the laws of the country.\n\n“Unlike the petitions against the Chief Justice, the president’s mandate in respect of the petitions against the Special Prosecutor and the Electoral Commissioner and her two deputies ends with conveying the petitions to the appropriate quarter, which in this instance is the Chief Justice. That was done a couple of weeks ago,” he said.\n\nHe added; “A total of ten petitions were received: seven against the Electoral Commissioner and her two deputies, and three against the Special Prosecutor. The president has no role beyond that, and in that regard, we cannot speak to it. The Chief Justice’s office may be in a good position to comment. The president will once again be called to act when the Chief Justice has determined prima facie.”\n\nLIVESTREAMED: Kwakye Ofosu addresses Ghanaians at Government Accountability Series\n\nAllegation of government promoting LGBTQ content in Ghana’s education curricula:\n\nFelix Kwakye Ofosu also rejected claims that the government is promoting LGBTQ content in Ghana’s education curricula, which were made by the Member of Parliament for Assin South, Rev John Ntim Fordjour, describing such assertions as exaggerated and misleading.\n\nHe indicated that the teaching materials had been withdrawn by the requisite educational authorities well before the MP made his allegations.\n\n“There was some public outcry, and I think that curricula were withdrawn even before Rev Ntim Fordjour went out to make these claims. The NaCCA itself had withdrawn about 700 or so copies of the manual. It's an instruction manual for teachers of physical education and health in Senior High Schools. I think there's just one line about the description of gender, which proved problematic and offensive to the sensibilities of the people of Ghana.\n\n“That has subsequently been withdrawn. Indeed, I have been sent a copy of the approved manual by NaCCA, and it does not contain the offending words. So, that matter has been addressed,” he said.\n\nHe added, “Government certainly is not about to promote anything that is at variance with Ghanaian culture. So, whereas we welcome scrutiny, it's important that such claims are toned down. It is not something that we should encourage. It is not necessary to attempt to put what is not there in place. It doesn't help anybody.”\n\nTransport woes in Accra:\n\nThe minister addressed the recent worsening transportation challenges in the nation’s capital, Accra, which he attributed to “artificial shortages” created by some drivers.\n\n“After the persistent reduction in fuel prices, there are some operators who have decided to engage in undue practices by creating artificial shortages.

Goals are disallowed by the narrowest of margins, celebrations are frozen mid-joy, and matches are reshaped by decisions measured in millimetres. Drawing on experience as both a football commentator and a trained physicist, Petras Anaab Ali, the author, explores how VAR’s quest for absolute precision has paradoxically amplified uncertainty rather than eliminated it.</p><p>Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as a conceptual lens, the article argues that football has encountered a fundamental limit similar to that found in physics: the more precisely certain elements are measured, the greater the uncertainty introduced elsewhere. In the case of VAR, ultra-fine measurements of offsides and incidents come at the cost of disrupted flow, lost momentum and ignored contextual factors that define the game’s rhythm and emotional core.</p><p>Rather than rejecting technology outright, the article calls for a more nuanced understanding of VAR’s limitations. Just as physics acknowledges the boundaries of measurement, football must rethink how precision is applied, ensuring that technology serves the spirit of the game instead of undermining it.</p><p>Petras Anaab Ali (MPhil) is a staff of the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA, Ghana), a Sports Analyst & Commentator on Radio Univers and Legon Today, and an MPhil Student, University of Ghana Physics Department.</p><p>Read the full article below.</p>"

The organisation also criticised restrictions placed on media coverage of protests and demonstrations.</p><p>PIN states that these actions constitute serious violations of digital rights, media freedom, and democratic principles at a crucial moment in Uganda’s electoral process.</p><p>According to the organisation, evidence shows that internet access across Uganda has been disrupted. Social media platforms, messaging services, and online news websites have all been affected.</p><p>PIN noted that this happened despite earlier public assurances from the Uganda Communications Commission that the government did not plan to shut down the internet during the elections.</p><p>\"The shutdown represents a troubling reversal of that commitment and raises serious concerns about transparency, accountability, and respect for fundamental rights,\" PIN said.</p><p>The organisation noted that Uganda has a history of internet shutdowns during elections, including those in 2016 and 2021. In the 2021 elections, a near-total internet blackout lasted for several days. PIN said this severely affected freedom of expression, access to information, election observation, media reporting, and economic activities.</p><p>“Repeating these measures despite widespread national, regional, and international condemnation demonstrates a continued pattern of using digital restrictions as a tool of election management,” the statement added.</p><p>Paradigm Initiative also condemned directives that prevent media houses from covering protests or demonstrations during this period. According to the group, such restrictions violate media freedom and the public’s right to information. They also weaken the role of the media as a watchdog in a democratic society.</p><p>PIN warned that blocking coverage of protests can spread misinformation, increase tension, and reduce public trust in the electoral process.</p><p>The organisation referred to Article 29 of Uganda’s Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression, freedom of the press, and access to information. It also noted that Uganda is a signatory to international agreements such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which protect these same rights.</p><p>PIN stressed that any restriction on these rights must be lawful, necessary, proportionate, and for a legitimate purpose. It said blanket internet shutdowns and platform restrictions do not meet these standards and are against Uganda’s constitutional and international obligations.</p><p>At the global level, PIN cited the United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, who has consistently stated that internet shutdowns are disproportionate and cannot be justified, even during elections or periods of political tension.</p><p>The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights has also recently urged the Government of Uganda to keep the internet on and respect freedom of expression and media freedom during the current electoral period. This call is based on existing African human rights standards that discourage government interference with digital access.</p><p>PIN further noted that Internet Service Providers and technology companies operating in Uganda have a responsibility to respect human rights. Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, they are expected to be transparent and avoid participating in unlawful or excessive restrictions on internet access.</p><p>Paradigm Initiative is calling for the immediate restoration of full internet access across Uganda. It also wants an end to all forms of digital disruption during and after the elections.</p><p>The organisation further demands the withdrawal of all directives that restrict media coverage of protests, demonstrations, or political events.</p><p>It also calls on Internet Service Providers to be accountable by publishing transparency reports that clearly explain government orders affecting internet access.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Bank fixed deposits have long been a popular savings and investment instrument in Ghana. For decades, individuals, institutions, and businesses have relied on fixed deposits (FDs) as a perceived “safe” way to earn predictable returns. However, recent market developments, financial sector clean-ups, and rising investor losses have exposed fundamental weaknesses in how fixed deposits are marketed and understood.</p><p>This article argues that Ghanaian banks should stop advertising fixed deposits directly to the investing public as investment substitutes and instead raise funds through properly structured bonds and money market instruments, while restricting fixed deposits primarily to core banking clients. This approach aligns better with global best practices, enhances transparency, and protects investors.</p><p>What Is a Bank Fixed Deposit?</p><p>A bank fixed deposit is a time-bound deposit where a customer places funds with a bank for a specified period typically 30, 91, 180, or 365 days at a fixed interest rate. The depositor cannot withdraw the funds before maturity without incurring penalties.</p><p>In Ghana, fixed deposits are widely marketed as low-risk investments, short-term wealth accumulation tools and alternatives to treasury bills and mutual funds. However, a fixed deposit is not an investment security; it is a bank liability, and the depositor becomes an unsecured creditor of the issuing bank.</p><p>The Core Problem in Ghana’s Fixed Deposit Market</p><p>Aggressive Rate-Based Advertising</p><p>Banks in Ghana aggressively advertise fixed deposit rates often without adequate disclosure of the bank’s financial health, liquidity risk, credit risk, and maturity mismatch risk. This has led many investors to make rate-driven decisions, not risk-informed investment decisions. Above all, the marketers of these fixed deposit products are not licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Ghana to advise or sell investment products.</p><p>Blurring the line between Banking and Investment Products</p><p>Fixed deposits are being marketed in ways similar to money market funds, government securities and corporate bonds</p><p>Yet unlike these instruments, fixed deposits are not tradable, no secondary market, lack full disclosure standards and are not priced daily on a mark-to-market basis.</p><p>Why Banks Should Issue Bonds or Money Market Products Instead</p><p>Transparency and Disclosure</p><p>Bonds and money market instruments require offering documents, risk disclosures, clear tenor and use of funds and regulatory approval from SEC. This protects investors and improves market discipline across board.</p><p>Proper Matching of Funds</p><p>Banks often use short-term fixed deposits to fund long-term loans, infrastructure financing and corporate facilities</p><p>This creates liquidity and rollover risk. Corporate Bonds allow banks to match asset and liability maturities properly to avoid default or rollover risk.</p><p>Market Discipline and Pricing Efficiency</p><p>When banks issue bonds investors price risk properly, weak institutions pay higher yields and strong institutions benefit from lower funding costs.

      "content": "<p>Security agencies at the Takoradi Port have uncovered one of the largest suspected opioid trafficking attempts in recent months, after Customs officials intercepted two containers packed with illicit pharmaceutical drugs and undeclared merchandise.</p><p>The containers, which arrived at the Atlantic Terminal Services Limited (ATSL) and were imported by an individual identified as Maxwell Boateng, were declared as carrying ceiling fans. However, intelligence-led inspection uncovered a far more troubling cargo — 25 million tablets of Tapentadol, an opioid drug not approved for medical use in Ghana.</p><p>Sources within the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority disclosed that the discovery was made during routine frontline checks, when officers detected inconsistencies in the packaging of the goods. The unusual concealment patterns raised red flags, triggering a detailed examination.</p><p>Following the suspicion, the Takoradi Sector Commander, Walter Blankson, ordered immediate surveillance of the containers to forestall any possible interference. The containers were later subjected to a full unstuffing exercise, which confirmed the presence of large volumes of concealed pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Laboratory sampling conducted on six boxes of Tapentadol and two boxes of another tablet identified as Timaking confirmed the substances to be unauthorised drugs. Further inventory established that the consignment carried a staggering 25 million Tapentadol tablets.</p><p>In addition to the drug find, Customs officers also uncovered trade infractions involving the declared goods. Across the two containers, 2,591 ceiling fans were found to be undeclared, pointing to deliberate misrepresentation on the bills of entry.</p><p>The seized containers have since been transferred to the custody of the state at the Takoradi Collection facility. Meanwhile, 20 packets of the confiscated drugs have been forwarded to the Customs Laboratory for advanced forensic testing.</p><p>Investigations are ongoing, with authorities awaiting further instructions from the Commissioner of Customs.</p><p>The joint operation brought together key national security and regulatory bodies, including the Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC), Food and Drugs Authority (FDA), National Security, and the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB).</p><p>Officials say the interception forms part of intensified national efforts to clamp down on the growing influx of synthetic opioids and unregulated pharmaceutical substances, which pose serious public health and security risks to the country.</p>"

More retail shops mean we will be able to get the products closer to the doorstep of every home,” she reiterated.</p><p>Adiza also emphasised that the 2026 regional expansion initiative will factor in accessibility to educational institutions, hospitality destinations, and homes across the 16 regions.</p><p>This, she said, will ensure jobs in all the locations, employing people from the localities, and also giving local vendors opportunities to retail.</p><p>Furthermore, 2026 will see Electroland solidify its market leadership through a strategic new partnership as the sole distributor for TCL mobile phones in Ghana.</p><p>Appreciation to Brand Amsaddors</p><p>The media relations head on behalf of the brand also expressed gratitude to the outstanding brand ambassadors of the company who have helped the promotions reach nationwide.</p><p>Key among them are media personalities Serwaa Amihere and Deloris Frimpong Manso (Delay), A.J.

John Ntim Fordjour, has called on the Minister of Education to appear before Parliament to address concerns over a controversial definition of gender identity in the Senior High School Physical Education and Health (PH&E) teachers’ manual.</p><p>Speaking on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen show, Rev. Fordjour described the content as dangerous and accused the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA) of breaching public trust by allowing the material to be printed and circulated.</p><p>“You cannot trust NaCCA again. They breached the trust Ghanaians had in them by allowing this to come out. They printed the books themselves when their mandate is to review before printing. This is a deliberate, systematic attempt, and it is dangerous,” he said.</p><p>Rev. Fordjour insisted the issue goes beyond politics, highlighting concerns about the credibility and moral direction of Ghana’s education system. He claimed that if the controversy had not been exposed, the definition would not have been revised, and he noted that other definitions in the manual also pose challenges.</p><p>He called for the immediate recall of all hard copies of the manual, deletion of digital versions, and a clear directive to schools and regional education directors. He also urged NaCCA to convene a stakeholder meeting to agree on definitions that align with Ghanaian culture and moral values before reprinting.</p><p>“The Minister of Education needs to come to Parliament to answer on this matter and give assurances that this will not happen again,” he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a press release dated January 13, 2026, NaCCA acknowledged that the definition of “gender identity” in the Year Two PH&E (Elective) Teacher Manual does not reflect Ghanaian culture, norms, and values. The Council stressed that the national curriculum itself does not include such content.</p><p>According to the manual, gender identity was defined as a person’s deeply felt internal experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, and may include being male, female, or a blend of both.</p>"

Based on this, he expressed confidence that prices of some goods and services have gone down.</p><p>Using fuel prices as an example, the minister pointed to a significant reduction compared to previous years. He noted that during the previous government, filling his campaign vehicle cost about 2,000 Ghana cedis, while the same vehicle now takes about 1,400 Ghana cedis, representing a saving of 600 Ghana cedis.</p><p>He argued that anyone who previously paid higher fuel prices but now pays less cannot deny that the economic improvements have had some positive impact on household expenses.</p><p>Mr Kwakye Ofosu further highlighted that fuel once sold at about 23 Ghana cedis per litre, translating into over 100 Ghana cedis per gallon. He explained that current prices are far lower, which he described as clear evidence of easing costs.</p><p>On the prices of everyday goods, the minister disclosed that many items have recorded price reductions. He referred to data presented to Parliament’s Trade Committee by the Ghana Union of Traders Association during discussions on the 2025 Budget.</p><p>According to him, GUTA submitted evidence showing price cuts on more than 4,500 different goods, following improvements in key macroeconomic indicators.</p><p>He emphasised that while challenges remain, it is inaccurate to suggest that none of the economic gains have reached the pockets of ordinary Ghanaians.</p>"

But it will be very difficult, as Senegal has more energy after easily beating Sudan and Mali in the knockout stage, and also has one more day to recover after the quarter-finals. Meanwhile, Egypt endured a real battle with Côte d’Ivoire, and before that, in the round of 16, they were forced to play 120 minutes against Benin.</p><p>Sadio Mané is still the leader of the Senegal national team – the former Liverpool winger has scored 1 goal and provided 3 assists in the tournament. The Lions of Teranga have a wider selection of top-class players than the present-day Egypt national team. But the Pharaohs have Mohamed Salah, who is having an outstanding tournament - 4 goals and 1 assist in 4 games. The Liverpool player’s role in the team is huge both on the pitch and in the dressing room. Besides, the Senegalese shouldn’t forget about Omar Marmoush, who has scored 2 goals.</p><p>Egypt are considered the underdogs, but this role actually suits the team. The Pharaohs have great spirit and discipline, and 33-year-old Salah’s desire to become African champion for the first time in his career could be one of the key factors for success.</p><p>Odds: W1 - 2.23, X - 3.035, W2 - 4.12. To reach the final: Senegal - 1.51, Egypt - 2.39</p><p>Morocco vs Nigeria, January 14</p><p>This will be a battle between the best defense (Morocco conceded only 1 goal) and the best attack (Nigeria scored 14 times). At the same time, the Super Eagles, who conceded 4 goals in the group stage, found their balance in the knockout stage, and in the matches against Mozambique (4-0) and Algeria (2-0), they allowed only 5 shots on goal, with goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali making 0 saves as there was nothing to save. However, the previous AFCON runners-up may lose this balance again due to the suspension of key defensive midfielder Wilfred Ndidi. Ndidi is perhaps even more important to the Nigerians than the injured Azzedine Ounahi is to the Atlas Lions.</p><p>Morocco’s defense, which made a name for itself at the 2022 World Cup, hasn’t faced such strong opponents in this tournament as Victor Osimhen (4 goals, 2 assists), Ademola Lookman (3 goals, 4 assists) and Akor Adams (2 goals, 2 assists, all goal contributions made in the knockout stage). The tournament hosts have the brilliant Brahim Díaz, who has scored in each of the 5 matches, while Ayoub El Kaabi has yet to score in the knockout stage. Apart from this duo, only Ismael Saibari has scored goals for the Atlas Lions at this Africa Cup of Nations.</p><p>Odds: W1 - 2.363, X - 3.155, W2 - 3.565.

      "content": "<p>By Nana Sifa Twum, PhD</p><p>In early January 2026, President John Dramani Mahama announced that his administration is considering reforms to Ghana’s outdated TV licence regime, proposing to replace it with a broader public media levy to strengthen funding for public broadcasters. The shift, still under Cabinet deliberation and to be presented to Parliament, is rooted in the belief that the existing licensing framework is insufficient to sustain robust public media operations and that a new levy could help Ghana’s media institutions better fulfil their public-interest mandates.</p><p>President Mahama reinforced this view during his visit to GBC, emphasising that the institution’s reach across Ghana’s diverse communities supports national development and must be adequately supported through institutional reforms, including, if necessary, adjustments to constitutional provisions on media freedom and independence to create a more enabling environment.</p><p>What Is the Media Levy Proposal?</p><p>Under the existing Television Licensing Act (1966), households and commercial entities that own television sets are required to pay an annual TV licence fee, which is modest and limited in scope. President Mahama’s proposal is to amend this law to introduce a public media levy with broader applicability and greater revenue-raising potential. The intention is to provide the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) and potentially other public media bodies with a more sustainable and predictable funding source, enabling them to strengthen operations, modernise infrastructure, and invest in content production.</p><p>Media analysts argue that a media levy will enable public broadcasters to fulfil their core mandates, informing, educating, and entertaining and if I should add, encouraging, motivating, and teaching citizens, without being overly dependent on irregular government subsidies or the limited fees collected under the archaic TV licence regime.</p><p>Why Introduce a Media Levy?</p><p>There are several motivating factors behind President Mahama’s drive to overhaul the media funding architecture. Such include</p><p>Financial Sustainability of Public Media</p><p>GBC and similar institutions have long struggled with constrained budgets, outdated equipment, and insufficient funds for content development. Current TV licence revenues are marginal and do not meet the demands of competitive broadcasting, particularly in a media landscape increasingly driven by digital platforms and multimedia content. A reimagined levy is intended to close this gap.</p><p>Modernisation and Expansion</p><p>Ghana’s media environment has evolved significantly with the rise of private TV, radio, online, and social media outlets. However, public media often lag behind in technology adoption and talent retention issues that stem in part from weak funding frameworks.</p><p>Public media have an essential role in covering national events, educational programming, and rural outreach where commercial incentives are weak. A dedicated levy could underwrite such public interest programming.</p><p>From where the President sits, and given what most of us don’t know about the national economic implications of the media levy, coming out with such a laudable proposal is commendable. Any new levy, especially one touching millions of households and businesses, carries broader economic ramifications. These can be examined from both the macro-fiscal and micro-economic perspectives.</p><p>The fiscal impact and revenue mobilisation of the proposed media levy require critical assessment. Ghana has been navigating a complex economic landscape, balancing fiscal responsibility with growth-oriented reforms. In 2025 and 2026, Mahama’s government has already pursued several tax policy changes, including abolishing the Electronic Transfer Levy (e-levy) and the COVID-19 Health Recovery Levy, to ease financial burdens on citizens and promote business activity.</p><p>While these moves returned billions of cedis to households and firms and sought to stimulate economic activity, they also created revenue shortfalls that the government must offset elsewhere. Abolishing the COVID-19 levy alone is estimated to eliminate roughly GH¢3.7 billion in annual revenue, representing around 2% of total tax revenue in recent years.</p><p>In the Ghanaian context, this might be the best solution to the country’s media funding challenges, as the TV licensing model has not been effective over the years.</p><p>In this context, a media levy could serve several economic purposes. It would help diversify revenue sources by broadening the tax base through a dedicated media levy that could replace revenue lost from abolished taxes without reintroducing politically unpopular levies such as the e-levy.</p><p>It would also reduce reliance on direct public funding. By securing external levy revenues, public media would become less dependent on direct government allocations, which are vulnerable to fiscal constraints, and it would also stimulate the media sector. Overall, stable funding could incentivise investment in technology and content, expanding employment opportunities in journalism, production, and technical fields.</p><p>However, it is also essential to weigh the potential downsides, such as a new levy that does not impose additional costs on households and businesses, especially if structured as a broad-based media tax rather than a narrow licence fee. Funding adequacy must be well in focus, as the proposed levy must be carefully calibrated. If it is too low, it may fail to meaningfully support media institutions, and if too high, it becomes regressive or economically burdensome.</p><p>Strengthening Public Broadcasting Quality</p><p>Public media like GBC have the mandate to provide impartial news, educational programming, and culturally relevant content. Better funding could:</p><p>This could result in a more vibrant media ecosystem capable of competing with private broadcasters, particularly in depth of coverage and public accountability.</p><p>Promoting Media Independence</p><p>A predictable revenue stream might reduce undue political interference by lessening reliance on ad hoc government budgetary support. However, this depends on how the levy is institutionalised. Mechanisms must be put in place to ensure independence of revenue collection and allocation, lest the levy becomes a tool for political influence. Strengthening constitutional and statutory protections for media freedom, as hinted at by Mahama’s references to reviewing relevant provisions, will be crucial.</p><p>Broader Media Sector Effects</p><p>The introduction of a levy may also yield positive spillovers: for instance, a boost to digital innovation through stable funding models. Public media might invest more confidently in digital platforms, operational apps, streaming, and online news portals, thereby bolstering their relevance in the digital age and ensuring wider global coverage.</p><p>It would also seek to boost content diversity, which is paramount in today’s media space. Funding could support niche and minority-language programming, enhancing representation.</p><p>The success of the proposed levy will depend on careful design. Considerable care must be taken when designing the levy collection process. There must be high equity considerations. This is to avoid regressive outcomes. It is critical that low-income households should not bear disproportionate burdens.</p><p>Compliance and administrative matters in such levies can, at times, pose challenges. Effective systems for collection and enforcement must be established, potentially requiring partnerships with telecoms, financial institutions, or tax authorities.</p><p>President John Mahama’s media levy proposal represents a strategic effort to modernise Ghana’s media financing architecture and enable public broadcasters such as GBC to operate on a more secure and sustainable footing. Set against a backdrop of broad tax reforms aimed at easing economic pressures on citizens and businesses, the levy could help diversify government revenue sources and strengthen Ghana’s public media.</p><p>The policy’s success hinges on careful calibration, balancing fiscal needs with equitable cost distribution, safeguarding media independence, and ensuring that the additional funding translates into observable improvements in media quality, professionalism, and service to the public. Done right, the media levy could be a significant step toward a robust and financially stable media landscape that contributes meaningfully to Ghana’s democratic and economic development.

      "content": "<p>The Gambia Reparations Commission has begun paying reparations to victims of human rights abuses committed under the regime of former dictator Yahya Jammeh, marking a major step in the country’s transitional justice process.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, January 12, 2026, the commission described the payments as a “significant milestone” toward restoring justice and dignity to victims and their families.\n\nAmong those covered in the first phase of payments are the families of 44 Ghanaians who were killed in the 2005 migrant massacre, one of the most notorious crimes linked to Jammeh’s rule.\n\nSpeaking on the development on TV3's News Central on Tuesday, January 14, 2026, \nWilliam Nyarko, the Executive Director of the Africa Center for International Law and Accountability (ACILA), said the move by The Gambia represents progress, especially after years of stalled accountability.\n\n“It is definitely a step forward  considering how far this case has struggled. There've been many Gambian issues that started back before Yahya Jammeh became president\", he noted.\n\nWilliam Nyarko explained  that many Gambians have suffered abuses over the years, however, the 2005 incident drew regional attention after foreign nationals, including 44 Ghanaians were caught up in the violence, while attempting to travel through Senegal to The Gambia en route to Europe. \n\nThe foreign nationals were wrongly accused of being mercenaries plotting to overthrow Jammeh.\n\n“When they were arrested, they had no weapons or equipment. They should have been taken through the court system, but that did not happen,” Nyarko said.\n\nWatch CCTV footage of fatal stabbing of 53-year-old US-based Ghanaian security guard\n\nHe noted that civil society groups have been working closely with the victims’ families since 2018, particularly those based in Ghana’s Ashanti, Bono, Ahafo and Western regions, to document their cases.\n\n“We have the information. With the exception of two or three survivors, all of those killed have families who will receive compensation on their behalf.\n\nReparations key to securing justice for Africans worldwide – Mahama\n\n“The money part is one bit, but the justice part, what I call Gambia 2.0, is bringing Jammeh and his co-conspirators to justice,” he added.\n\nThe Gambia Reparations Commission has begun disbursing payments to victims of human rights violations that occurred between July 1994 and January 2017.\n\nAnnouncing the milestone on Monday, January 12, 2026, the commission said the initiative is aimed at “facilitating justice, restoring dignity, and supporting the recovery of victims who endured violations during the specified period.”\n\nPayments are being disbursed in phases, starting with victims whose violations occurred in 1994. \n\nThe commission is actively contacting eligible victims and victim groups to verify information and complete the necessary steps for disbursement.\n\nVictims who have not yet registered or updated their details are urged to contact the commission as soon as possible.\n\nThe 44 Ghanaians, along with about 15 other West African nationals, mainly young men believed to be travelling towards Europe, were arrested and executed by Gambian security agents in July 2005 during the rule of former President Yahya Jammeh. \n\nThe killings sparked outrage across the region, especially in Ghana.\n\nIn 2021, The Gambia’s Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) concluded that the killings were state-sanctioned and recommended justice and reparations. \n\nJKB/AE\n\n'To hell with them' – Professor Frimpong Boateng fires back at NPP\n\nTWI NEWS</p>"

      "content": "<p>Renowned Nigerian leadership expert, Rev Dr Sam Adeyemi, has challenged business leaders to rethink how success is defined, insisting that true leadership is measured not by short-term gains but by lasting impact.</p><p>He delivered the message at the 13th Jospong Leadership Conference (JLC) 2026, organised by the Jospong Group and attended by business executives, public sector leaders, entrepreneurs, and young professionals.</p><p>Addressing the gathering, Dr Adeyemi said leadership must be viewed as stewardship rather than ownership.</p><p>He explained that authority, institutions, and influence are held in trust for a season and must be passed on stronger than they were inherited. According to him, leaders who see power as personal property often weaken organisations instead of building them.</p><p>He noted that the difference between managers and legacy leaders lies in perspective.</p><p>While managers focus on control, targets, and immediate performance, legacy leaders invest in people, systems, and continuity. “Every organisation we inherit must be handed over better than we found it,” he stressed.</p><p>Dr Adeyemi warned against the hidden cost of chasing results without considering their long-term effects.</p><p>Drawing from real-world experience, he cited cases where leaders delivered profits but damaged morale, lost young talent, and weakened institutional culture. He described the loss of young people as the loss of the future, urging leaders to think beyond today’s pressure.</p><p>Values, he said, were most visible during difficult times, adding that values are easy to declare when things are going well but are truly tested when decisions come at a cost.</p><p>He explained that leadership under pressure exposes character, integrity, and discipline, just as a game of golf reveals personal character.</p><p>To underline the importance of trust, Dr Adeyemi referenced the Johnson & Johnson Tylenol crisis in the United States, where the company recalled millions of products at huge financial loss to protect public safety. That decision, he said, built public trust that lasted for decades and set new industry standards. “Trust is a long-term asset,” he noted.</p><p>He added that organisations that fail to protect trust are forced to spend heavily on controls and monitoring, while those that build trust enjoy loyalty and stability. In his view, choosing trust over profit is both a moral and strategic leadership decision.</p><p>The man of God also entreated leaders to move from personal success to collective significance. He explained that while success is about targets and recognition, significance is about empowering others and building institutions that outlive individual leaders. “Legacy leaders don’t just perform; they multiply people,” he said.</p><p>He further cited Microsoft’s cultural transformation under CEO Satya Nadella as an example of how organisations must renew their culture to remain relevant. The shift toward learning, humility, and collaboration, he said, proved that culture is as important as strategy.</p><p>Dr Adeyemi expressed confidence in the next generation of African leaders, noting that many young professionals are already influencing key sectors with strong ethical foundations.</p><p>He reminded the audience that leadership is temporary, but its consequences are permanent, urging them to lead with values, vision, and responsibility.</p>"

It is usually spoken with confidence, a smooth smile, and absolutely no notes.</p><p>“Don’t worry. I’ll flow.”</p><p>That sentence should worry everyone.</p><p>Poor preparation, or no preparation at all, is the second most common mistake beginner MCs make. It shows up early and announces itself boldly. Names are mispronounced. Titles are mishandled. The programme is treated like a suggestion. And somewhere in the room, an organiser quietly wonders how this all went wrong.</p><p>Let’s be honest. Flow is not magic. Flow is preparation that has learned how to relax.</p><p>The microphone is a truth serum. It reveals immediately whether you’ve done the work. The hesitation before a name. The nervous page flip. The rambling transition while you try to remember what comes next. Audiences may be polite, but they are never fooled.</p><p>On a continent where titles, protocol and hierarchy matter, preparation is not optional. Call a doctor “Mr”. Demote a traditional leader. Promote the wrong official. The room changes temperature instantly. The audience smiles, but respect has already slipped through your fingers.</p><p>Yet many new MCs believe preparation kills spontaneity. Nothing could be further from the truth. Preparation doesn’t restrict you. It frees you.</p><p>When you know the programme, you can adjust without panic. When you understand the speakers, you can introduce them with authority. When you grasp the purpose of the event, you can read the room correctly. Without preparation, you’re not improvising. You’re guessing, loudly, in public.</p><p>I once watched an MC confidently announce the arrival of a guest of honour who was already seated in the front row. The guest smiled. The audience shifted. The organiser aged five years in five seconds. That moment could have been avoided with a seating plan and a short briefing.</p><p>Professional MCs prepare because they expect things to go wrong. A speaker will be late. A video will fail. A programme item will be cut. Preparation gives you options. Without it, confusion takes the microphone.</p><p>Preparation is also a matter of respect. A board meeting is not a wedding. A state function is not a product launch. A memorial is not an awards night. Tone is not accidental. It is deliberate. When MCs ignore this, they turn important moments into uncomfortable ones.</p><p>There is also quiet arrogance in poor preparation. It assumes personality can replace diligence. It assumes charm will carry the day. It rarely does.</p><p>The best MCs arrive early. They ask questions. They confirm pronunciations. They understand protocol. Then they step on stage and make it look effortless.</p><p>That effortlessness is earned.</p><p>So the next time you are tempted to “just flow”, remember this: flowing without preparation is like driving at night with no headlights. You may move forward, but everyone else is bracing for impact.</p><p>Do the work. Respect the room. Honour the moment. And above all — stay on cue.</p><p>Kafui Dey is the author of How to MC Any Event.

The celebrations will also feature corporate social responsibility activities and an international conference highlighting GEXIM’s contribution to economic development.</p><p>Established under the Ghana Export-Import Bank Act, 2016 (Act 911), GEXIM was created to help shift Ghana away from the export of raw materials towards value-added production, competitive industries and sustainable job creation.</p><p>According to Mr Mensah, the bank has spent the past decade translating that mandate into practical support for businesses through financing, guarantees and technical assistance across priority sectors.</p><p>“Export growth is not a slogan; it is a system,” he noted. “It requires patient and well-structured capital, effective risk-mitigation tools, market intelligence, and institutions that can align incentives from the farm gate to the factory, and from the factory to global markets.”</p><p>He said EximBank’s interventions have helped Ghanaian enterprises expand production, improve quality and access new export markets, while contributing to export diversification and industrial development in the real economy.</p><p>Looking ahead, Mr Mensah announced that the bank will hold its 10th Anniversary International Conference from March 25 to 26, 2026, at the Kempinski Gold Coast Hotel in Accra, under the theme, “A Decade of Enabling Export Trade and Industrial Transformation: Resetting GEXIM for the Next Frontier.”</p><p>“This theme recognises the progress made, but it also acknowledges that the next decade will demand greater agility, deeper partnerships, smarter financial instruments, and stronger alignment with Ghana’s evolving economic priorities,” he explained.</p><p>He said the conference would provide a platform to examine global shifts in export finance, explore blended finance models, strengthen access to finance for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), and generate actionable recommendations to guide GEXIM’s medium- to long-term strategy.</p><p>Focused sessions will cover the use of artificial intelligence and digital tools in export finance, credit-enhancement solutions for MSMEs, and opportunities within key value chains such as garments and apparel, poultry, rice and oil palm.</p><p>“As Chief Executive, I see this conference as both a reflection and a reset,” Mr Mensah said. “It is about positioning GEXIM—and Ghana—to compete more effectively in the next phase of global trade.”</p>"

      "content": "<p>Dear Fellow Citizens of Africa,</p><p>There is a quiet misunderstanding that has cost our continent more than coups, debt, or even corruption. It is the belief that government, governance, citizenship, and governing are the same thing. They are not. Confusing them has silently stalled our nations, weakened institutions, blurred accountability, and normalised failure as routine. This confusion is subtle and persistent. It hides behind elections, constitutions, cabinet reshuffles, and policy launches. It survives transitions of power and often outlives charismatic leaders. Because it is rarely named, it is rarely corrected.</p><p>GOVERNMENT IS WHO HOLDS POWER.GOVERNANCE IS HOW POWER BEHAVES.GOVERNING IS HOW POWER IS EXERCISED EACH DAY.CITIZENSHIP IS A PERMANENT RESPONSIBILITY.</p><p>When these distinctions collapse, our countries appear busy yet remain stagnant. Noise replaces progress. Activity is mistaken for achievement. Governments change, but outcomes remain stubbornly familiar. Government is the most visible of these concepts. It consists of presidents, prime ministers, ministers, parliaments, councils, and executive offices temporarily entrusted with authority. Governments are designed to change. Authority is borrowed and time-bound.</p><p>Citizenship, however, is permanent.</p><p>Before anyone becomes a president, a prime minister, or a politician, they are first citizens. They are born into citizenship long before they assume office, and they return fully to citizenship when authority expires. Titles end. Mandates lapse. CITIZENSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES DO NOT.</p><p>AUTHORITY IS TEMPORARY. CITIZENSHIP RESPONSIBILITY IS PERMANENT</p><p>When leaders forget that they are citizens first, power slowly turns into entitlement rather than service. When citizens forget that leaders are fellow citizens temporarily entrusted with authority, accountability weakens, and deference replaces scrutiny. Governance, unlike government, does not campaign or seek applause. It lives quietly in systems, rules, norms, enforcement mechanisms, and institutional discipline.</p><p>Governance determines whether laws apply equally, whether public funds are protected, whether contracts are honoured, and whether wrongdoing carries consequences. Strong governance creates predictability. Investors trust it. Citizens rely on it. Civil servants respect it. Weak governance produces discretion, fear, and uncertainty. According to the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators, countries in the top quartile of governance quality have GDP per capita levels more than three times those in the bottom quartile. Countries that strengthened governance between 2000 and 2020 recorded sustained growth rates that were two to three percentage points higher than those of countries that did not.</p><p>THIS IS NOT IDEOLOGY. IT IS ARITHMETIC</p><p>Governing is the daily act of translating authority into outcomes. It is where leadership is tested and exposed. It reflects the quality of decision-making, implementation, coordination, and service delivery. Governing reveals whether institutions function or merely exist. A nation can have a government without good governance. Budgets can be passed while hospitals deteriorate. Policies can be announced while schools underperform. Ministries can exist while coordination collapses.</p><p>A BUSY STATE IS NOT THE SAME AS A FUNCTIONAL STATE</p><p>Across African cities, the evidence is plain. Flooding returns season after season despite repeated projects. Traffic congestion drains billions in productivity. Power outages persist despite massive investments. These are rarely technical failures. They are governance failures disguised as engineering problems. Roads are built but not maintained. Power plants are constructed but not integrated. Hospitals are expanded but understaffed. Schools are open but under-resourced. These are not failures of ideas. They are failures of systems. Many still believe development will arrive with the election of the right leader. History suggests otherwise. Strong leaders without strong systems produce fragile progress. When they leave, everything collapses. Strong systems with average leaders produce steady outcomes.</p><p>STRONG NATIONS ARE NOT BUILT BY STRONGMEN. THEY ARE BUILT BY STRONG SYSTEMS</p><p>The world offers powerful lessons.</p><p>Botswana built strong fiscal and governance institutions before diamonds transformed its economy. Transparent rules and disciplined public financial management turned mineral wealth into a long-term development driver. Rwanda's post-crisis recovery was anchored in performance management, institutional accountability, and consistent execution. Between 2000 and 2022, Rwanda recorded an average growth of about seven per cent while improving health outcomes, agricultural productivity, and service delivery. Vietnam lifted over forty million people out of poverty between 2002 and 2022, not through constant political reinvention, but through predictable governance frameworks that supported micro and small enterprises and ensured policy continuity. Beyond the Global South, two classic examples stand out.</p><p>Singapore did not achieve prosperity through frequent changes of government or reliance on personalities. It built an incorruptible civil service, enforced the rule of law, and prioritised long-term planning over short-term politics. Governments changed, but governance remained disciplined. Norway offers another enduring lesson. Before oil revenues transformed its economy, Norway invested deeply in governance. Transparent fiscal rules, independent institutions, and the creation of the Government Pension Fund Global ensured that resource wealth served future generations, not political cycles. Governments changed. Governance endured. Today, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund exceeds one trillion US dollars and remains one of the most transparent in the world.</p><p>SINGAPORE AND NORWAY PROVE THAT GOVERNANCE OUTLIVES GOVERNMENTS</p><p>This distinction explains why corruption often survives regime change. Transparency International estimates that countries with weak governance lose between five and ten per cent of GDP annually to corruption and inefficiency. In Africa alone, illicit financial flows exceed $80 billion each year, more than the continent receives in development assistance.</p><p>Changing leaders without fixing systems only changes who benefits.</p><p>The confusion between government and governance also explains the African resource paradox. Our continent holds over thirty per cent of the world’s mineral reserves and nearly sixty per cent of its uncultivated arable land. Yet, exports raw materials and imports finished goods at enormous cost.</p><p>THE ISSUE IS NOT RESOURCES. IT IS GOVERNANCE.</p><p>Mining licences are issued without long-term planning. Environmental safeguards are ignored. Revenues are poorly managed. Communities are displaced. When resources are exhausted, the land is degraded, and the economy is no stronger.</p><p>EXTRACTION WITHOUT GOVERNANCE CREATES WEALTH WITHOUT DEVELOPMENT</p><p>Yet the most overlooked dimension of this crisis lies with us, the citizens. The most dangerous assumption we make is that governance is the responsibility of those in office alone. It is not. Governance is a civic culture long before it becomes a state function. When citizens abdicate responsibility, authority expands unchecked. This is where a critical truth must be stated plainly and without hesitation. Citizens do not need to hold board seats, director titles, or senior public offices to understand or practise governance. Governance is not a credential. It is a discipline. It is not conferred by appointment. It is learned through values and exercised through daily choices.</p><p>Governance lives wherever fairness is demanded, rules are respected, and accountability is expected. It is practised by parents insisting on responsibility at home, by teachers enforcing standards in classrooms, by traders honouring agreements in markets, by community leaders managing shared resources transparently, and by citizens who ask difficult questions without fear or favour.</p><p>WHEN GOVERNANCE IS TREATED AS AN ELITE SKILL, SOCIETIES WEAKEN. WHEN IT IS TREATED AS A CIVIC DUTY, NATIONS STRENGTHEN</p><p>Boards and public offices may formalise governance, but they do not own it. Governance fails most catastrophically when citizens believe it belongs only to those in suits, offices, or positions of authority. The absence of titles does not excuse the absence of conscience.</p><p>This is why governance education must start early.</p><p>Governance is not an elite concept reserved for ministers or boardrooms. It is the daily understanding of fairness, responsibility, accountability, transparency, and consequence. A child who understands why rules exist grows into an adult who questions power responsibly.</p><p>CITIZENS DO NOT NEED AN OFFICE TO PRACTISE GOVERNANCE</p><p>We practise it when we insist on fairness in schools, discipline in associations, transparency in cooperatives, accountability in local councils, and responsibility in community leadership. The failure to teach governance early produces societies fluent in slogans yet ill-equipped to interrogate systems. Excuses become normalised. By the time individuals enter public office, poor habits are already entrenched. This is why many African nations endlessly restart. New governments arrive, but old behaviours persist. New policies are announced, but weak systems quietly sabotage them. The problem is not ambition. It is the absence of a governance-minded citizenry. Strong nations are not built only in parliaments. They are built in classrooms, homes, markets, faith institutions, and civic spaces. Governance literacy must be treated with the same seriousness as civic education itself. Without it, democracy becomes performative.

      "content": "<p>…as LECIAD holds orientation for 2025/26 new entrants.</p><p>By Ernest Bako WUBONTO</p><p>Diplomat-in-Residence at the Legon Centre for International Affairs and Diplomacy (LECIAD), University of Ghana (UG), Amb. Kwabena Baah-Duodu, has underscored the significant influence of international forces and actors on the quality of life in the local economy.</p><p>Speaking at the orientation ceremony for 2025/26 new entrants, held on January 5, 2026 at the LECIAD auditorium – UG Campus, he emphasised that global forces—economic, political, technological and environmental— shape the pattern of everyday life in ways that often feel invisible.</p><p>These forces influence local economies in Ghana through mechanisms such as international trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), commodity price volatility and the policies of international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.</p><p>The power of ideas and actors</p><p>Ambassador Baah-Duodu, who previously served as Ghana’s permanent representative to the United Nations (UN) in Geneva and Ambassador to Switzerland and Austria from 2006 to 2008, urged students to view global forces as ‘human constructions’ rather than unchangeable natural phenomena.</p><p>He cited the shift toward fee-paying models in public universities as an example of an imported global practice that has reshaped the local educational landscape.</p><p>“The actors, usually the great powers in Europe, America and Asia – USA, Great Britain, Russia, China – are not natural entities; they emerge as human constructions and can be changed over time,” he stated.</p><p>He challenged the new students to contribute to a narrative shift that ensures international relations work to the benefit of, rather than the detriment of, the Ghanaian people.</p><p>For Ghana, as a highly import-dependent nation, he stressed that global commodity prices such as oil, cocoa and gold directly affect local costs of fuel, food and wages, as fluctuations in cocoa prices have ripple effects on farmers’ incomes and communities’ living standards.</p><p>Additionally, geopolitical tensions elsewhere, particularly conflicts or sanctions like the Russia-Ukraine War and Donald Trump’s trade sanctions, can disrupt supply chains, leading to shortages or inflation locally.</p><p>“Global forces determine the prices of goods, the quality of public services. Movement of people across borders brings remittances, skills and cultural exchange that reshape local communities,” he added.</p><p>A call for impactful research</p><p>The Acting Director of LECIAD, Prof. Peter Quartey, congratulated the incoming Master’s and PhD students on joining the only combined International Relations and Diplomacy programme in Ghana.</p><p>He highlighted that graduate students have the opportunity to reimagine, analyse, explore and contribute to the improvement of the nation’s development and the continent at large.</p><p>Prof. Quartey expressed that being among the top one percent of Ghanaians with graduate education is a privilege, and comes with the responsibility to improve the living conditions of fellow citizens.</p><p>He urged students to produce knowledge that empowers local communities. “Let your research speak not only to the audience abroad but communities that need your expertise to improve.</p><p>“What humans made, others can remake and transform. As you go through your graduate studies, ask better questions, be brave with your ideas, don’t be a coward, as cowards don’t make a great impact,” he said.</p><p>He indicated that LECIAD keeps working with the industry collaboratively to enhance the quality of the programme and give students practical experience.</p><p>LECIAD is in the process of undertaking a traceability study to know the whereabouts of past students and how they are performing in their respective fields.</p><p>On her part, Senior Assistant Registrar, Eccles Andoh, outlined the various guidelines students need to follow and the available facilities students have full and restricted access to.</p><p>She also touched on student support systems, further urging students to be responsible for their personal safety and security.</p><p>Touching on dress code, she said: “LECIAD has diplomats and high-level dignitaries coming around randomly; hence, students are to always dress either smart casual or formal.”</p><p>Addressing modern academic challenges, Senior Research Fellow, Dr. Linda Darkwa, informed students that while the University of Ghana is developing an official AI policy, the use of such tools must be clearly disclosed to avoid charges of plagiarism.</p><p>Furthermore, faculty members Dr. Afua Yakohene and Dr. Juliana Appiah provided insights into International Development and Regional Integration, respectively.</p><p>Ghana’s first Ambassador to Qatar and visiting lecturer, Emmanuel Enos, urged students to be open-minded and read widely as well as strive to be analytical and critique publications constructively with superior arguments.</p><p>Industry collaboration and academic integrity</p><p>The orientation highlighted LECIAD’s commitment to bridging the gap between theory and practice.</p><p>The curriculum will include regular diplomatic seminars – interactive sessions with foreign diplomats stationed in Ghana to discuss national policies and diplomatic communication; and practical exposure with training in diplomatic entertainment, hospitality and official communication.</p><p>LECIAD was an establishment by the nation’s premier university in partnership with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to train the staff of the ministry on diplomacy and international relations.</p><p>Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Antoine Semenyo has taken to life seamlessly at Manchester City and is already beginning to repay the £62.5m fee handed to Bournemouth to sign him.\n\nSemenyo scored and provided an assist in a memorable debut in the FA Cup third round on Saturday, though that 10-1 trouncing came against League One side Exeter City.\n\nHe then notched his second in as many games, scoring the opener inside the cauldron of St James' Park, helping City take control of their Carabao Cup semi-final against holders Newcastle.\n\nHe later put the ball in the net again, a goal eventually ruled out after a lengthy check from the video assistant referee, before City sealed the 2-0 win.\n\nThe 26-year-old adds a different dimension to City's attack, describing himself as \"powerful, quick and strong\", as well as \"clinical\" - that last attribute could prove to be a vital factor in this season's Premier League title race and City's hunt for silverware.\n\n\"I was in the right area to tap it in and we were victorious so I am happy,\" Semenyo said after the game. \"The whole environment here is perfect.\n\n\"Everyone is confident and wanting to achieve the best. I have come into that and they helped with my confidence and made me feel welcome.\n\n\"It has been a lot but I have enjoyed it so far. I am picking things up very quickly and enjoying it. I am playing with a smile on my face and enjoying every moment.\"\n\nSemenyo is set for another milestone on Saturday if he makes his Premier League debut at Old Trafford in the Manchester derby.\n\nWho stands to gain from signing Semenyo?\n\nWinners\n\nCity's goalscoring burden has fallen mostly on the broad shoulders of star striker Erling Haaland this season, with the Norway international netting 39 goals in 34 games for club and country.\n\nBut the prolific frontman has hit a sticky patch of late, scoring just once in his past six games and last scoring from open play against West Ham on 20 December.\n\nPlaying as a wideman mostly from the right, Semenyo's proficiency in front of goal for Bournemouth has him on 10 Premier League goals so far this season, sitting third on the top-flight scoring charts behind new team-mate Haaland and Brentford's Igor Thiago.\n\nHaaland can not only expect a new avenue of goalscoring service – as showcased by Semenyo's assist against Exeter - but that weight of finding the net can now be shared with a player who scored a total of 32 goals for the Cherries.\n\nSemenyo adds a versatility to City by being able to play anywhere in the front three, enhancing the options available to manager Pep Guardiola.\n\nThe Ghanaian's speed, direct running and cool finishing has already been displayed in Manchester this season, with a brilliantly taken goal against United at Old Trafford in the chaotic 4-4 draw.\n\nGuardiola will be hoping his newest recruit can provide that sort of anarchy and unpredictability alongside the craft and vision of Phil Foden and the magic of Rayan Cherki in the final third.\n\nCity captain Bernardo Silva said: \"He looks not just a very good player but also a very good guy, which fits right in with the team.\n\n\"He is a fantastic guy who wants to help us. Hopefully he can keep going.\"\n\nA bit of both…\n\nThough losing another of their star players will no doubt sting, Bournemouth have brought in a sizeable transfer fee for another player they have sold since the end of last season.\n\nSemenyo's sale provides a huge profit on a player they signed for £10m from Championship side Bristol City only three years ago.\n\nThe south coast side have now brought in around £250m since the summer, but have been stripped of another prized asset having already lost Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi, Milos Kerkez and Dango Ouattara.\n\nBut it means boss Andoni Iraola will have cash to splash not only to replace Semenyo but also improve other areas of the squad.\n\nLosers\n\nSemenyo had been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United, but it has proven to be a tumultuous couple of weeks for the Red Devils.\n\nNot only did they miss out on the forward to their bitter rivals, they also sacked head coach Ruben Amorim, with ex-midfielder Michael Carrick taking interim charge for the remainder of the season.\n\nCarrick's first game comes against City on Saturday and Semenyo could have graced the Old Trafford turf in a red shirt, but will instead head to the venue as an opposition player having already hurt the United backline this season.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal are aiming for a first title in over two decades and hold a six-point advantage at the summit but will be nervously looking over their shoulders knowing one of their nearest challengers have strengthened their side.\n\nCity are now overloaded with players on the right wing, meaning one of Oscar Bobb or Savinho may well leave the club this January or in the summer.\n\nNorwegian Bobb missed almost the entirety of last season with a leg fracture and is injured again – the 22-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBrazilian Savinho is out of action too and has, at times, been unconvincing since his £31m move from Girona in 2024, struggling to nail down his place in the side, and Tottenham were in talks to sign him during the summer.\n\nGuardiola has said attacking players are judged by their output but the 21-year-old has managed to contribute only two goals and three assists in 23 appearances this season.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The detention of Ghana’s former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta in the United States has escalated into a complex legal and diplomatic crisis following his targeted arrest in the nation's capital. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) apprehended the former finance minister at approximately 11 a.m. on Tuesday, January 6, and he now awaits a decisive hearing scheduled for January 20 before an immigration judge.</p><p>Ghana’s Ambassador to the U.S. Victor Smith confirmed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is also involved. This dual-agency involvement suggests the case transcends a simple visa expiration.Ofori-Atta’s elite legal team is moving to challenge what they describe as an \"ambush-style\" detention. The upcoming federal hearing will serve as the first formal step in determining whether he will be granted an adjustment of status or face accelerated repatriation to address a 78-count corruption indictment in Accra.</p><p>Origin of the Legal Crisis</p><p>The saga began in early 2025 when Ghana’s Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) summoned Mr. Ofori-Atta for questioning. He departed Ghana on January 2, 2025, for medical treatment at the Mayo Clinic. After missing multiple scheduled appearances, the OSP declared him a wanted person in February 2025 and a fugitive from justice. An INTERPOL Red Notice was formally published on June 5, 2025, under the charge of “Using Public Office for Profit,” triggering the current international effort to secure his return.</p><p>The Targeted Arrest at Westlight</p><p>Details have emerged characterizing the arrest as a \"targeted operation\" rather than a routine sweep. On the morning of January 6, this year, ICE agents surrounded Mr. Ofori-Atta as he emerged from the Westlight Building in Washington, D.C. This luxury apartment complex, located at 1111 24th Street NW, is an upscale residence in the West End neighborhood, where units sell for up to $4.2 million (approximately GH₵45.2 million).</p><p>Current Custody at Caroline Detention Center</p><p>Following his arrest, Mr. Ofori-Atta was transported to the Caroline Detention Facility in Bowling Green, Virginia. The facility is approximately 89 miles from the site of the arrest, a journey of about 90 minutes. He is currently being held at this location, which serves as a primary center for ICE operations in the region. Investigative journalist Manasseh Azure Awuni noted, “Everything I’m hearing from sources who were present shows this was a targeted operation. It appeared to be an ambush.”</p><p>The Prosecution’s Case: 78 Counts of Corruption</p><p>The Ghanaian government’s accusations center on a 78-count indictment filed in November 2025. Prosecutors allege Mr. Ofori-Atta led a \"criminal enterprise\" that caused a financial loss of GH₵1.4 billion to the state. The charges focus on the Strategic Mobilisation Limited (SML) contract and the National Cathedral project. The state claims he abused his office for private gain by influencing procurement. Dr. Justice Srem-Sai noted, “The Ministry of Justice and the Attorney-General’s Department are not merely spectators but active participants.”</p><p>Ofori-Atta’s Defense and Medical Justification</p><p>Mr. Ofori-Atta’s legal team denies all criminal allegations and calls the charges politically motivated. They maintain his presence in the U.S. strictly for health reasons. His legal team confirmed he underwent a radical prostatectomy on June 13, 2025, at the Mayo Clinic. The defense argues the OSP bypassed due process by declaring him a fugitive while he was incapacitated. Frank Davies stated, “If the Attorney General says he is investigating something, he should terminate the investigation... stop coming on the radio.”</p><p>Nationality and Visa Status</p><p>Ambassador Smith disclosed that U.S. authorities are holding three of Mr. Ofori-Atta’s Ghanaian biometric passports. These documents have settled the question of his nationality for immigration officials. Mr. Ofori-Atta had traveled to the United Kingdom and returned to the U.S. shortly before his arrest. His legal permission to stay reportedly lapsed around November 29. Victor Smith stated, “If the immigration judge has no basis to keep him here longer, he will be on the next flight to Ghana.”</p><p>Health and Detention Conditions</p><p>Questions regarding his health were addressed by the Ghanaian mission after consulting with ICE. Medical personnel at the facility conducted a formal assessment. They concluded that he was medically fit to be held in the center. While he is on medication, he has been granted full access to his prescriptions. Victor Smith noted, “The ICE people confirmed that he was all right... they were convinced and were assured that he was okay.”</p><p>The Elite Legal Defense</p><p>Mr. Ofori-Atta has assembled a formidable legal team, including a former U.S. Attorney General. His team is pursuing a petition for \"adjustment of status\" to allow him to remain in the U.S. legally. Immigration lawyer Jonelle Ocloo observed, “When you see the lawyers that he’s hired... that is an indication of somebody who’s not going easily.”</p><p>Consular Refusal and Upcoming Hearing</p><p>A diplomatic rift emerged when the former minister declined assistance from the Ghanaian embassy. Ambassador Smith expressed surprise after Mr. Ofori-Atta refused to meet with consular officers. The mission sought access to ensure his treatment complied with international protocols. Smith remarked, “Shutting the door in our face and not wanting to see us under any circumstances was a bit unfortunate.”</p><p>Offshore Probes and Local Friction</p><p>The case has intensified following disclosures by Attorney General Dr. Dominic Ayine regarding offshore investigations. He confirmed that local and foreign investigators are tracking dealings separate from the SML case. However, Frank Davies dismissed these claims as irresponsible public commentary. Davies argued, \"If the Attorney General said he is investigating something, he should terminate the investigation... stop coming on the radio.\"</p><p>Calls for Accountability</p><p>The unfolding saga has triggered demands for transparency among former government appointees. Legal practitioner John Darko emphasized that high-profile figures must face probes to uphold the rule of law. He noted that the public expects accountability as governance remains a priority. John Darko stated, \"A competent lawyer prosecutes his case in court,\" suggesting the focus should remain on formal legal processes.</p><p>Contesting ICE Custody</p><p>Mr. Ofori-Atta’s legal team in the U.S. has filed a court process to challenge his detention by ICE. They argue he is not an \"illegal immigrant\" because his adjustment of status petition was pending. The defense maintains that ICE may have acted without knowledge of this application. Frank Davies explained, “The position now is that the lawyers in America have filed a process in court to challenge what ICE has done.”</p><p>Medical Recovery and National Reputation</p><p>The former minister is reportedly in the recuperative stage following his surgery. His lawyers state he will return to Ghana once he receives a medical \"all clear.\" However, private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu characterized the situation as a \"national embarrassment.\" Kpebu stated, “The longer this goes on, the more we suffer embarrassment as a nation that your finance minister is running away; he is a fugitive from justice.”</p><p>Visa Revocation and Accelerated Repatriation</p><p>New evidence from the Ministry of Justice suggests Mr. Ofori-Atta’s return to Ghana may be imminent. Deputy Attorney-General Dr. Justice Srem-Sai revealed that the U.S. visa was actively revoked in June 2025. This distinguishes his status from a passive expiration. Dr. Srem-Sai stated, “The information we have is that his visa was revoked... So he has been living in America without a visa.”</p><p>The Jan. 20 Master Calendar Court Hearing: Legal Mechanics</p><p>The proceeding set for January 20 is a Master Calendar court hearing—a preliminary administrative stage in the U.S. immigration court system. Unlike a traditional criminal trial, this hearing serves as a procedural gateway where the judge will formally read the \"Notice to Appear.\" This is the critical juncture where the defense—which includes a former U.S. Attorney General—will move to consolidate his medical claims into a formal request for \"Relief from Removal.\" The outcome will dictate whether the case moves to a protracted \"Merits Hearing\" or if the court grants an expedited bond.</p><p>A Collision of Law, Medicine, and Politics</p><p>The fate of the former finance minister now rests on the delicate balance between his right to medical recovery and the state's demand for judicial accountability. While the Ghanaian government views his stay as a deliberate evasion of justice, his defense frames it as a necessary medical exile. As the January 20 hearing approaches, the international community watches a case that will define the limits of diplomatic protection and the reach of sovereign legal authority. This intersection of high-profile litigation and human rights ensures that the verdict will have lasting implications for both U.S. immigration policy and Ghanaian governance.</p>"

This is also expected to address the current delays in securing visa appointments, which we all agreed must be fixed,” he said.\n\n\nThe US Embassy in Accra is expected to brief the media in the coming days on the new World Cup-related visa initiatives, which are designed to streamline applications and minimise disruption for eligible Ghanaian travellers.\nGhana has been placed in 2026 World Cup Group L alongside England, Croatia, and Panama.

He was interviewed by the Special Prosecutor,” he noted.\n\nHe explained that after investigations into President Mahama, no wrongdoing was established.\n\n“Eventually, it was found that the allegations were unfounded and nothing untoward had happened in that particular matter, so, he is walking a free man,” he stated.\n\nTouching on the ongoing issues surrounding Ken Ofori-Atta, Felix Kwakye Ofosu said the former minister should cooperate fully with investigators if he is confident of his innocence.\n\n“So, if Ken Ofori-Atta is confident that indeed he has done nothing untoward, I think that he should avail himself to the appropriate authorities to carry out their investigations. The Attorney General has indicated that he has sent a formal request to the authorities in the United States of America who are processing it,” Kwakye Ofosu emphasised.\n\nAccording to him, developments surrounding the matter have also drawn the attention of US immigration authorities.\n\nThe minister added that the former finance minister is expected to appear in court later in January 2026.\n\n“Along the line, because of the concerns raised by the Ghanaian government, I think that his visa was revoked which then made it an issue for ICE. So, he's currently in detention. We are aware that on the 20th of this month [January] he will be appearing in court. Depending on the outcome of the court proceedings, I think that the appropriate steps will be taken,” he stated.\n\nNtim Fordjour demands immediate recall of LGBTQ teaching materials from schools\n\nKwakye Ofosu concluded by reiterating the government’s commitment to accountability.\n\n“The Ghanaian government is invested in holding all public officials to account and if the investigative authorities believe that there's a basis to investigate, I think they should be encouraged to carry out that investigation,” he concluded.\n\nMAG/AE\n\n'To hell with them' – Professor Frimpong Boateng fires back at NPP\n\nTWI NEWS</p>"

As part of the outreach, children received meals, drinking water, and hygiene kits containing bathing soap, sponges, toothbrushes, and toothpaste — items often inaccessible to children living on the streets.</p><p>While the outreach provided much-needed relief, the experience on the ground also highlighted the scale and urgency of streetism in urban communities. The pressure and competition observed during food distribution reflected the daily reality many of these children face — one defined by scarcity, instability, and survival.</p><p>Beyond material support, the Street-to-Smile Project was intentionally designed to communicate care, worth, and hope. Through simple but thoughtful engagement, the initiative sought to remind each child that they are seen, valued, and deserving of compassion.</p><p>“Our work is rooted in the belief that every child deserves dignity, care, and the opportunity to thrive — regardless of their circumstances,” said Dr. Lady Talata Danladi, Founder.</p><p>The LTD Foundation is a non-profit organisation committed to transforming lives through compassion, empowerment, and opportunity. Its work focuses on supporting underprivileged children, empowering women, mentoring young people, and strengthening vulnerable communities through practical, people-centred interventions</p><p>Founded by Dr. Lady Talata Danladi, a medical doctor, the LTD Foundation was born out of personal conviction and life experiences that shaped a deep commitment to service and sustainable impact. The foundation’s approach prioritises long-term change over one-off charity, addressing both immediate needs and underlying vulnerabilities.</p><p>As part of its commitment to sustainable impact, the Lady Talata Danladi (L.T.D) Foundation calls on government institutions and relevant stakeholders to strengthen coordinated, long-term interventions aimed at reducing streetism. Emergency outreach provides relief, but sustainable change requires structured rehabilitation facilities, access to education and psychosocial support, and vocational training pathways that enable reintegration and self-reliance for street-connected children and young people. Strengthening child protection systems and supporting vulnerable families are equally critical to preventing children from returning to the streets and breaking the cycle of deprivation.</p><p>The Street-to-Smile Project represents one aspect of the foundation’s growing portfolio of initiatives. A second phase of the project is scheduled to take place in the coming days, during which the LTD Foundation will extend support to orphanages in northern Ghana with essential items such as clothing, shoes, school bags, and learning materials.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2026, the LTD Foundation plans to expand its impact through structured initiatives, including a Pathways Mentorship Programme for adolescents and young people, education support projects, women empowerment and skills-development programmes, and community-based outreach initiatives</p><p>The LTD Foundation welcomes support from individuals, organisations, and corporate partners through donations, volunteering, partnerships, and advocacy. Contributions in cash or in kind help strengthen the foundation’s ability to reach more vulnerable communities and deliver sustainable impact.</p><p>As the Street-to-Smile Project continues, the LTD Foundation remains committed to its core belief: that compassion, when paired with action, has the power to change lives and shape generations.</p><p>Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Where there is Victor Osimhen for Nigeria, there is hope.\n\nThe 27-year-old striker and his Nigeria team-mates face hosts Morocco in the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations on Wednesday, with five wins from five games so far.\n\nOsimhen is joint second in the tournament's top scorers list with four goals, level with Liverpool and Egypt's Mohamed Salah and one behind Morocco's Brahim Diaz.\n\nBut the tournament has not been plain sailing for Galatasaray striker Osimhen or the Super Eagles, with a high-profile on-field argument threatening to overshadow their impressive displays.\n\nHis spat with Ademola Lookman during the 4-0 last-16 win over Mozambique attracted plenty of headlines, with reports - which Nigeria have denied - even suggesting Osimhen had threatened to quit the camp.\n\nOsimhen confronted Lookman over his failure to pass the ball to him in a clear goal-scoring position and then signalled to manager Eric Chelle to replace him, which he duly did. Osimhen went straight down the tunnel at full-time, not taking part in the on-field celebrations.\n\nThe storm has since died down, with players - including Osimhen himself - and Chelle insisting any internal conflict had been squashed soon after the final whistle.\n\nBut people who know him best insist Osimhen would not be the same striker without that will to win and say any accusations of selfishness towards the striker could not be further from the truth.\n\nWith two goals needed to level the late Rashidi Yekini as Nigeria's record goal scorer with 37, Osimhen is on the brink of cementing his place in Nigerian football folklore.\n\nHe said: \"It doesn't matter if I equal the record or I surpass it. I think Mr Rashidi Yekini is the best striker the Super Eagles have ever produced.\n\n\"I'm just doing my best. Of course, it's amazing to be part of the history of the Super Eagles.\n\n\"So I'm just trying to win something important for my country. And I think with the help of my team-mates, I'm on that path.\"\n\n'He's had a tough upbringing'\n\nBorn in Lagos, the early years of the Galatasaray striker's life were unimaginably difficult.\n\nThe death of his parents meant he would sell water in traffic as a child, while having to fend for himself, his brother and his sister.\n\nFormer Nigeria defender William Troost-Ekong, who was once Osimhen's captain, explained the impact of the striker's childhood on his competitiveness.\n\n\"He's had a tough upbringing,\" he told BBC World Service.\n\n\"He had to fend for himself for his brother and his sister. Unfortunately, he lost his parents quite young. So he's got this real hunger and hustle.\n\n\"He's the first in the box. He wants to score everything. Even when we walk around the hotel, he's the first at the buffet at dinner. He'll be elbowing his way in there as well.\n\n\"He's fantastic to have. I feel like you want that spirit in the team. That makes him a real leader and something that, for our generation and the generation of players that are now to come, can learn a lot from.\n\n\"I think that makes him also the superstar that he is.\"\n\n'They see him as a leader'\n\nThe brilliant Yekini scored 37 goals in 58 games for his country, whereas Osimhen sits on 35 in 50 games.\n\nIf Osimhen goes on to break Yekini's record at this Africa Cup of Nations, then Nigeria may well go on to lift their fourth continental crown as they bid to atone for not qualifying for this summer's World Cup.\n\nBut Troost-Ekong believes the first thing on Osimhen's mind is winning his first Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nHe said: \"All of us would love to be etched into history.\n\n\"Yekini is so legendary. I'm looking forward to seeing Victor surpass that, but I think it also sums up how he is as a person to make sure that he hit the respect he's kept for Yekini.\n\n\"So yes, I think he's got many more goals to come and I think he'll probably be the next one to chase for the next generation.\"\n\nWith the record in touching distance, Nigerian football journalist Oluwashina Okeleji described Osimhen as the \"new king of Nigerian football\".\n\nOkeleji said: \"He has been earmarked for that success since he was playing in the under-17s.\n\n\"Within the squad now, he's regarded as undoubtedly the biggest star and people look up to him. That's why when he's not there, Nigeria seems to crumble.\n\n\"He may not wear the armband, but they see him as a leader - everything goes through him.\"\n\nOsimhen scored the goal that secured Napoli's first Serie A crown in 33 years\n\nA title-winning club career\n\nWherever Osimhen is playing his football, goals follow and that has been evident throughout his club career.\n\nOsimhen first made himself known across Europe in the 2019-20 season, when he scored 18 times in all competitions for Ligue 1 side Lille before securing a transfer to Napoli for a club record fee.\n\nItaly was where Osimhen's career really took off as he became one of the world's most feared strikers.\n\nHis 26 goals in 2022-23 put him in the Napoli history books as they lifted their first Scudetto in 33 years. In doing so, Osimhen overtook George Weah as the highest-scoring African in Serie A with 47 goals.\n\nThe end of the Nigerian's time in Naples came in the summer of 2023, with a move to the Premier League on the cards, but Turkish side Galatasaray secured the formidable striker's signature.\n\nInitially on loan, Osimhen netted 26 times in 30 games to finish as the league's top scorer as Galatasaray won the league and cup double.\n\nNow a permanent player for the Turkish champions, Osimhen is once again in fine scoring form. He has struck six times this term in 12 games and continues to be one of football's most feared forwards.</p>"

      "content": "<p>As of January 2026, new electricity tariffs have taken effect in Ghana. These adjustments are not ad hoc measures, nor are they sudden policy impulses. They flow directly from the Multi-Year Tariff Review (MYTO) process undertaken by the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission, which is designed to realign electricity prices with the underlying cost of service over a defined regulatory period.</p><p>The recent joint statement issued by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the PURC on December 30, 2025, underscores this point. While acknowledging the impact of the new tariffs on workers’ living conditions, both institutions affirmed that reversing the MYTO decision would carry serious consequences for regulatory independence, sector stability, and the broader economy. In doing so, the statement implicitly recognises that tariff setting, however politically sensitive, remains anchored in economic fundamentals.</p><p>For households, businesses, and public institutions, tariff increases are never welcome. In Ghana, they are often perceived as political decisions imposed without sufficient regard for economic hardship. Yet electricity pricing, however sensitive, is ultimately governed by arithmetic rather than sentiment.</p><p>The PURC does not set tariffs arbitrarily. In determining electricity prices, the Commission is required to consider the full cost of producing and delivering power. This includes the cost of generation, transmission, and distribution, fuel prices and fuel mix, exchange rate movements, inflation, financing costs, operational efficiency, and system losses. It must also account for capital investment requirements necessary to maintain reliability and expand infrastructure.</p><p>The MYTO framework exists precisely because these cost drivers do not change randomly. Fuel prices fluctuate. Exchange rates move. Inflation erodes purchasing power. Assets depreciate. When tariffs are frozen or suppressed in the face of these realities, the financial gap does not disappear. It accumulates quietly within the system.</p><p>Ghana’s power sector provides a clear illustration. Decisions to delay tariff adjustments for short-term political comfort have historically created a widening gap between revenue and actual cost. That gap is eventually absorbed by state-owned utilities through mounting arrears, by government through guarantees and fiscal exposure, or by consumers through service deterioration. In effect, the cost is deferred rather than avoided.</p><p>The January 2026 tariff adjustments should therefore be understood as corrective rather than punitive. They represent the delayed reconciliation of prices with costs that have existed for some time. The MYTO process merely brings those realities to the surface in a structured and transparent way. As the TUC–PURC engagement itself reflects, the debate is no longer whether costs exist, but how society chooses to absorb them.</p><p>This is why tariff debates in Ghana feel cyclical. The same arguments recur because the underlying economic drivers remain unchanged. Electricity cannot be made affordable by ignoring its cost structure. Subsidies without discipline do not eliminate cost. They only redistribute it across time and across society.</p><p>For businesses, the new tariffs demand preparation rather than protest. Electricity can no longer be treated as a fixed overhead immune from policy and macroeconomic forces. Energy efficiency, load management, pricing assumptions, and contractual planning must now be integrated into the core business strategy.</p><p>For households, the adjustment highlights an uncomfortable truth. There is no such thing as free power. When tariffs do not reflect cost, the burden reappears through taxes, inflation, public debt, or unreliable supply. Transparent pricing, while difficult, is often more honest than concealed subsidies.</p><p>From a commercial law perspective, tariff credibility is central to investor confidence. Power sector contracts are structured on assumptions of revenue recovery approved by the regulator. When pricing signals are repeatedly distorted by non-economic intervention, risk premiums rise, financing costs increase, and investment appetite declines. Ultimately, consumers bear those costs.</p><p>Electricity pricing, therefore, represents a fundamental policy choice. Costs can be recognised openly through tariffs set under a predictable regulatory framework, or they can be hidden in debt accumulation, fiscal stress, and repeated sector bailouts. The recent TUC–PURC statement reflects an implicit acceptance of this trade-off, even as concerns about wages and cost of living are redirected toward broader economic policy.</p><p>Ghana cannot regulate its way out of arithmetic. The January 2026 tariff adjustments, grounded in the MYTO, are a reminder that economic reality always reasserts itself.

      "content": "<p>The Industrial and Commercial Workers’ Union (ICU) in Ghana has kicked strongly against any move to sell the Volta Aluminium Company Limited (VALCO), warning that such a decision would amount to sacrificing a strategic national asset for private gain.</p><p>In a press release dated January 14, 2026, and signed by its General Secretary, Morgan Ayawine, the union described VALCO as one of Ghana’s most prized state-owned enterprises, insisting that its challenges are not insurmountable and should not be used as justification for privatisation.</p><p>“For the avoidance of doubt, ICU-Ghana, as a key and indispensable stakeholder, is vehemently opposed to any sale, concession, or arrangement that would deprive Ghana of sole ownership of VALCO,” the statement said.</p><p>The union accused some unnamed, highly placed individuals within the Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADEC) and VALCO of scheming to sell the company to a private investor, questioning their motives and patriotism.</p><p>“The fundamental question is: Whose interest are they serving? Where lies their patriotism?” the union asked.</p><p>According to ICU-Ghana, VALCO has faced challenges before and successfully rebounded each time, maintaining its position as a critical pillar of the national economy. It cited recent efforts by management to expand the company’s capacity under the GIADEC project, including plans to process bauxite into value-added products, as evidence that the company remains viable.</p><p>The union also referenced a January 8, 2026, publication in the Ghanaian Times, which highlighted steps being taken by VALCO’s management to stabilise and grow the company.</p><p>Beyond concerns about ownership, ICU-Ghana warned that selling VALCO would worsen Ghana’s already troubling unemployment situation.</p><p>“At a time when the nation is grappling with serious unemployment, selling VALCO would inevitably result in job losses,” the statement said, adding that adequately resourcing the company could instead preserve existing jobs and create new ones.</p><p>The union further condemned reports of plans to sell portions of VALCO’s lands to private individuals, describing the move as “unconscionable” and a “grave betrayal of public trust.” It argued that the lands are held in trust for future expansion and must not be transferred.</p><p>Drawing parallels with previous government decisions, ICU-Ghana recalled its opposition to the sale of the National Investment Bank (NIB), which was instead recapitalised and has since become one of the country’s most successful investment banks. It also cited the aborted sale of four state-owned Golden Beach Hotels after resistance from organised labour.</p><p>The union urged the government to learn from these examples and resist any pressure to privatise VALCO.</p><p>“National assets must be preserved, strengthened, and developed to serve the collective interest of Ghanaians,” ICU-Ghana said, stressing that the government should invest in VALCO and retain it as a strategic national asset for present and future generations.</p>"

It is disgraceful and very embarrassing that somebody who served his country and has been called to his maker, and we are having difficulties in performing his funeral because he stood for the right course.</p><p>\"He was not violent. He went to court over something he thought was wrong. Why should that be an issue, or are we now living in a banana republic where the rich and strong now allow the weak and poor to suffer?\" he complained.</p><p>Mr. Richard Bayel also confirmed that the chief of Tuna told the family that, \"The issue he had with our late father, he has spent more than one million cedis, which we have to pay before they will consider allowing us to have the funeral of our late father. But the question is, what will be the reason for paying that money?</p><p>\"What did our late father do wrong by going to court? Don't sons and daughters of the region go to court, or is he the first to send a chief to court?\"</p><p>Mr. Bayel explained that the medical director of the hospital, one Doctor Roger, told him that, \"he has received a call from the chief of Sawla ordering him not to release our late father's body to us. And he said the mortuary attendant was as well instructed not to release the body to us, and that's where we are currently,\" he stated.</p><p>The Secretary of the Bole Chief, Haruna Obey, confirmed to JoyNews that the family would have to withdraw the court case and pay the full amount demanded or be forced to bury the deceased outside the region.</p><p>\"They can't bury him [late MP] without withdrawing the case from court. Or they can bury but not in our land. They can find a place in Tamale, Wa, or Wechau; their families are there. They can go and do the burial there,\" the secretary indicated.</p><p>He noted that it is only the burial that they are against because he [late MP] had been in contention with the former and current chiefs of Tuna. \"So, currently, the people there are agitating that he cannot be buried in our land.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, JoyNews sources at the Bolewura's palace have revealed the outcome of an emergency meeting held between the chiefs and the deceased's family at the palace of the Bole chief.</p><p>First among the conditions is that the family should denounce ownership of the said land in court, pay one hundred thousand cedis, and also withdraw the case from court.</p><p>When all these are met, the chiefs will then decide when and where the late Member of Parliament, Joseph Trumah Bayel, will be laid to rest. The chief did not end there but instructed personnel from the Ghana Police Service not to allow the late MP's body to be taken away from the Sawla Hospital mortuary.</p><p>JoyNews will keep our viewers informed as the matter develops.</p>"

      "content": "<p>By Juliet ETEFE ([email protected])</p><p>The Executive Chair-Africa Governance Centre (AGC), Benedicta Lasi, has cautioned that Africa risks missing out on China’s new zero-tariff regime for least-developed countries (LDCs) if governments fail to strengthen production, standards and export capacity.</p><p>She warned that “zero tariffs do not automatically mean exports” – stressing that without stronger economic fundamentals, the continent could face a situation where “zero tariffs will simply become zero exports”.</p><p>Ms. Lasi said Africa stands at a critical point as global economic dynamics – ranging from supply chain shifts to energy transitions and rising geopolitical competition – reshape development pathways.</p><p>Against this backdrop, she argued that China’s partnership with Africa, particularly Ghana, remains central but must evolve to meet emerging economic realities.</p><p>“The next decade must shift from inputs to outcomes; from projects to productivity; from infrastructure to industrial capacity; from aid to AfCFTA-driven competitiveness,” she noted.</p><p>She said this at a press briefing addressed by Chinese Ambassador Tong Defa in Accra.</p><p>She observed that while the last two decades of China–Africa cooperation has delivered significant infrastructure – roads, rail, energy and digital systems – the continent must now focus on translating these investments into industrial output and competitive exports.</p><p>“Africa does not need partners who admire our potential; we need partners who help us convert potential into production, production into exports and exports into jobs,” she stated.</p><p>According to her, Africa’s future development will be shaped by three defining realities: the urgent need for industrialisation, transformative potential of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the importance of strong governance and institutions.</p><p>“No nation has created prosperity by exporting raw materials forever. China’s own development proves this,” she said, adding that investment cannot thrive “where regulation is weak, bureaucracy is slow or policy signals are inconsistent”.</p><p>Ms. Lasi emphasised that African countries must enhance capacity across the value chain if they are to benefit meaningfully.</p><p>She outlined six priority areas: local manufacturing, meeting global standards, improving logistics and ports, expanding storage and cold-chain systems, strengthening export finance and coordinating regionally rather than acting in isolation. Failure to act decisively, she stressed, would mean the continent “must confront the uncomfortable truth” of being unable to take advantage of the preferential access China now offers.</p><p>She further called for a deeper, more structural approach to China-Africa cooperation. “Africa does not need more short-term projects. We need something deeper, more structural, more transformational,” she said.</p><p>She urged China to support the continent in building industrial zones that ensure African products enter Chinese markets competitively, establishing technical standards laboratories, developing skills pipelines and supporting digital governance systems which reduce corruption and enhance investor confidence.</p><p>“If the last 20 years were defined by infrastructure, the next 20 must be defined by industrialisation and shared prosperity,” Ms. Lasi said – underscoring that the next breakthroughs in China–Africa relations will come from industrial development rather than more infrastructure.</p><p>The Africa-China Centre for Policy and Advisory also noted in a publication that to maximise the benefits of China’s zero-tariff policy, Ghana should consider adopting data-driven reciprocity – basing tariff decisions on empirical trade data to identify low-risk product lines.</p><p>It further suggests that the country should: “Negotiate industrial partnerships and tie tariff concessions to Chinese commitments in local manufacturing, skills transfer and green investment; “Safeguard sensitive sectors: maintain protective measures for industries critical to job creation and value addi tion; Enhance export capacity: expand export financing, logistics and certification support for Ghanaian firms targetting the Chinese market; And strengthen institutional coordination to align efforts across Ghana export promotion authority, ministry of trade and industries, Ghana revenue authority, etc., thus ensuring coherent trade policy implementation.</p><p>ACCPA noted: “China’s zero-tariff initiative is more than a diplomatic gesture – it is a strategic opening that could redefine Ghana’s trade and industrial future. However, the ultimate outcome depends on how Ghana manages reciprocity.”</p><p>It added that: “A well-calibrated, data-driven approach can transform potential risks into opportunities for structural transformation. Ghana must act not as a passive recipient of goodwill but as an active partner shaping the terms of engagement. With strategic reciprocity, the country can turn this policy into a cornerstone of its 24-Hour Economy, advancing inclusive growth, industrial resilience and sustainable prosperity”.</p><p>In June 2025 China unveilled a landmark decision to grant zero-tariff access for all 53 African countries with which it maintains diplomatic relations, deepening commitment to South–South cooperation through trade rather than aid.</p><p>Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.</p>"

It includes sexual orientation, sexual behaviour, and sexual identity. How is that different? It’s still the same thing,” he said.</p><p>He added that the definition of sexual orientation remains unchanged.</p><p>“It describes a person’s pattern of emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction to others. The same thing remains here. It’s the same thing,” he stated.</p><p>According to him, the only noticeable changes were made to the definition of gender, while other areas he finds objectionable were left untouched.</p><p>“The only thing they have changed, only two things; every other problematic LGBT agenda still remains,” he said. “So if they change just these two and think they have cured it, they have not cured it.”</p><p>Based on this, the Assin South MP said he believes the inclusion of the content was intentional.</p><p>“That is why I conclude that it is not an error, it is not an omission, but it is a deliberate attempt to poison the minds of the people,” he said.</p><p>Rev Fordjour argued that if the issue were a genuine mistake, correcting it would have been straightforward.</p><p>“If it was an error, you just find one or two errors, and once you lift them out, it cures the mischief,” he explained. “But in this case, they are claiming that they have done a comprehensive review and determined that only gender identity and sexual rights definitions are problematic.”</p><p>He accused NaCCA of making selective changes in response to the specific concerns he raised publicly.</p><p>“When I raised only the two, they quickly went and said they had just changed those two. But all the other ones remain,” he said.</p><p>The MP urged the public to independently verify the revised material.</p><p>“Just do fact-checking,” he said. “The so-called revised one, which they have put back online, still contains all the problematic definitions under sex, under sexual orientation, under sexuality.”</p><p>Rev Fordjour warned that the continued presence of such content points to a broader agenda and poses risks to future generations.</p><p>“That is how deliberate this government wants to poison the minds of the future generation,” he added.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The UK has awarded contracts to build a record amount of offshore wind as part of its efforts to grow the country's clean electricity.</p><p>The projects span England, Scotland and Wales, including part ofwhat could become the world's largest offshore wind farm, off the coast of Scotland in the North Sea.</p><p>But some analysts warn that despite the record haul of offshore wind, the government will still struggle to meet its 2030 \"clean power\" target.</p><p>The government argues that wind projects are cheaper than new gas power stations and will \"bring down bills for good\", but the Conservatives have accused its climate targets of raising energy prices.</p><p>The offshore wind sector has been hit by rising costs in the past few years, and the Conservatives argue the contracts awarded in today's auction risk locking in high prices for decades.</p><p>One of the biggest successful projects is the first phase of Berwick Bank in the North Sea, which could end up as the largest offshore wind farm worldwide.</p><p>Other projects to be awarded contracts include the Dogger Bank South wind farm off the coast of Yorkshire and the Norfolk Vanguard project off the coast of East Anglia - while Awel Y Mor was the first successful Welsh project in more than a decade, the government says.</p><p>Chris Stark, who is overseeing the government's clean power push, described the results as \"a great outcome for the country\" and said that the mix of English, Scottish and Welsh projects would help to get electricity to people's homes more easily.</p><p>The government wants at least 95% of Great Britain's electricity to come from \"clean\" sources by 2030, partly to help tackle climate change by reducing carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. These clean sources include renewables – such as solar and wind – and nuclear energy.</p><p>Offshore wind is widely seen as the backbone of Great Britain's future clean electricity system, with plentiful wind resources off the country's coastlines.</p><p>The government wants at least 43 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by 2030 to help meet its clean power target.</p><p>That is a big step-up from its current offshore wind capacity, which stands at 16.6GW, with a further 11.7GW under construction, according to the government.</p><p>Building offshore wind and connecting it to the grid takes time – and many analysts have viewed this auction as crucial to get enough wind to meet its target.</p><p>The 8.4GW secured at this latest auction just about keeps the offshore wind target in reach, several analysts have told the BBC. But all those projects will still need connecting to the grid to generate electricity.</p><p>\"Getting that amount of capacity online by 2030 [will be] extremely challenging,\" said Nick Civetta, project leader at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.</p><p>The rise in offshore wind costs over the past few years is linked to factors like global supply chain pressures, increased steel costs and high interest rates, partly the result of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><p>Last year, energy company Orsted decided to \"discontinue\" one of the country's biggest wind projects, Hornsea 4, despite it previously being awarded a contract.</p><p>In this latest auction, traditional offshore wind projects - those fixed to the seabed - have been awarded an average fixed price of nearly £91 per megawatt-hour of electricity generated, in 2024 prices.</p><p>While that is down considerably from the first auction in 2015, it is up from the £82/MWh awarded at the last auction for new-build projects in 2024, also in 2024 prices.</p><p>The government acknowledges the rising cost of offshore wind, but argues that it should be compared with the cost of new gas power plants.</p><p>Its figures suggest that building and fuelling new gas plants would cost £147/MWh, including a carbon price - a charge for emissions.</p><p>\"We're confident that the renewables auction as a whole will help bring down bills for consumers,\" Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC News.</p><p>\"The truth is, those who say we should stick with fossil fuels are making a massive gamble, and they're gambling with the British people's energy bills,\" he added, pointing to the rise in gas prices at the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><p>But shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho said: \"They promised the British electorate that they would cut bills by £300. In fact, their bills have gone up by £200 since.</p><p>\"This is Ed Miliband's new grand plan to lower bills, and he signed up to contracts for offshore wind, which are the highest prices we've seen in a decade,\" she told BBC News.</p><p>Coutinho also suggested offshore wind brought extra costs, such as upgrading the grid.</p><p>Reform has also repeatedly attacked the cost of net zero, but the Lib Dems and Greens both support the expansion of renewables to tackle the threat of climate change and boost green jobs.</p><p>SNP and Plaid Cymru also support the growth of offshore wind, but argue Scotland and Wales should have control of their energy resources.</p><p>The results of the auction have been broadly welcomed by the energy industry and climate groups, although RSPB Scotland raised concerns about the possible impacts of the Berwick Bank farm on seabird populations.</p><p>The prices awarded by the government are fixed – in this auction, for 20 years. That certainty is designed to reassure developers that they will get a return on their upfront investment.</p><p>The projects can end up raising or lowering household bills, partly depending on how they compare to the price of electricity on the wholesale market. Their final impact on bills depends on a range of factors, including our future demand for electricity - which is expected to increase - and the price of gas.</p><p>Previous renewables projects funded by this scheme have often been given an effective subsidy. But analysts say they have brought some savings elsewhere, by displacing some of the most expensive gas power stations and reducing prices on the wholesale electricity market.</p><p>Today, wholesale market prices are usually driven by gas, but growing clean energy sources are expected to set the wholesale price more often in future.</p><p>In the Budget, the government announced changes which could cut energy bills by about £150, by moving some costs for older renewables onto general taxation and scrapping an energy efficiency scheme.</p><p>But at the same time, plans for grid upgrades - announced last year by the energy regulator Ofgem - will start adding to bills too.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The United States has nearly doubled its list of restricted nations to 39 countries, signaling a radical shift in immigration and travel ban policy. This expansion, effective January 1, 2026, adds four more African nations—Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and South Sudan—to the full travel ban list.</p><p>Additionally, Sierra Leone, Laos, and Syria were elevated from partial to total bans, while the policy now targets holders of Palestinian Authority travel documents. Collectively, these restrictions affect roughly 13% of the world’s population.</p><p>While Washington cites security vulnerabilities following a November shooting incident in D.C., the timing has sparked accusations of \"pay-to-play\" diplomacy. At the same time the administration is barring entry for many, it has launched the Trump Gold Card. This program allows wealthy noncitizens to buy expedited residency for a $1 million gift plus a $15,000 non-refundable processing fee.</p><p>Muted Diplomacy and Strategic Silence</p><p>Despite the severity of the measures, official responses across Africa have remained strikingly reserved. The African Union (AU) avoided direct condemnation, instead urging a \"balanced and evidence-based\" approach. Analysts suggest this silence is strategic as nations evaluate potential shifts toward global rivals like Russia and China.</p><p>In Mali, foreign ministry official Samuel Saye remarked that it was “too early for us to comment,” reflecting a broader trend of cautious observation. The AU remains focused on protecting the “long-standing ties” between the U.S. and Africa, even as those ties are tested by the new restrictions.</p><p>The African Perspective: Unease and Resilience</p><p>The expanded restrictions now target a significant portion of West and Central Africa. Beyond the total bans, 12 of the 15 countries facing new partial restrictions are African. These include nations like Nigeria, Senegal, and Tanzania, where citizens face severe hurdles for education, business, and tourism.</p><p>Highlighting the perceived bias, Abuja lawyer Ramlah Ibrahim Nok stated: \"I believe this position is unfair because it paints all Nigerians with the same brush.\" Malian resident Mohamed Keita added: \"It’s very unfortunate; this decision may penalize Malians who do business with the United States.\"</p><p>Ghana: The Diplomatic Exception</p><p>Ghana stands as a notable exception, having successfully navigated high-level negotiations to remain off the travel ban list. Earlier in 2025, the U.S. had imposed temporary visa limitations on Ghanaian citizens, but these were reversed in September. This allows Ghanaians to continue receiving five-year multiple-entry visas—a rarity in the current climate.</p><p>Foreign Minister Samuel Okudz\\eto Ablakwa called the outcome an “affirmation of the strong partnership” between the two nations. However, local shopkeeper Barikisu Yakubu expressed skepticism: “We see the planes landing with deportees every week. It feels like we traded our brothers for a stamp in a passport.”</p><p>Regional Security and Religious Pressure</p><p>Nigeria’s inclusion on the partial list is tied to high visa overstay rates and internal security concerns. The Trump administration has also intensified focus on religious freedom, recently designating Nigeria as a \"country of particular concern.\"</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified targeted visa bans on specific officials, stating the U.S. is taking “decisive action” against those supporting violations of religious freedom. This highlights a shift toward using immigration tools to pressure governments over the killing of Christians in the Middle Belt.</p><p>Global Reach: Beyond the African Continent</p><p>While Africa bears the brunt of the 2026 expansion, the policy deeply impacts the Middle East. The administration added Syria to the full travel ban list, joining existing bans on Iran, Yemen, Libya, and Afghanistan.</p><p>Critics argue the geographic clustering mirrors the controversial 2017 \"Muslim Ban.\" Supporters, however, insist the focus is purely on vetting deficiencies in conflict zones. By including Middle Eastern territories, the policy reinforces a pattern of exclusion that targets specific religious and regional demographics.</p><p>Dehumanizing Rhetoric and Radical Shifts</p><p>The administration has drawn fire for its starkly different treatment of African demographics. President Trump referred to Somali migrants as \"garbage\" and claimed they have \"ripped off\" the U.S. for billions. He stated: \"We don't want them in our country. Let them go back to their country and fix it.\"</p><p>U.S. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born former refugee, has emerged as a powerful voice of dissent. Her perspective is elevated by her lived experience of fleeing civil war and Kenyan refugee camps. She wrote: “The president knows he is failing, and so he is reverting to what he knows best: trying to divert attention by stoking bigotry. He denigrates not only Somalis but so many other immigrants, too, particularly those who are Black and Muslim.”</p><p>In contrast, the administration has created a unique refugee pathway for white South African Afrikaners, claiming they are victims of \"genocide.\" South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called these claims “regrettable” and based on “false allegations,” as the U.S. simultaneously boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa.</p><p>Business, Students, and the World Cup</p><p>The ban's ripple effects extend to the global economy and sports. The 2026 soccer World Cup presents a unique crisis. While athletes are exempt, fans from qualified nations like Senegal and Ivory Coast face \"partial restrictions\" based on visitor visa overstay rates of 4.3% and 8.5% respectively.</p><p>Taxi driver Pape Seye in Dakar summarized the frustration: “The players go, the money goes, but the people who love the game are left behind. It’s not a world cup if the world isn't invited.”</p><p>Paused Lives and Premium Access</p><p>A major policy shift has emerged regarding those already within the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security has suspended the processing of green card applications for refugees and asylees. Furthermore, the total refugee ceiling for FY 2026 was slashed to just 7,500—the lowest in U.S. history.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Trump Gold Card offers a fast-track to residency for a $1 million gift, while the proposed $5 million \"Trump Platinum Card\" promises tax benefits for wealthy foreigners. Shev Dalal-Dheini of the American Immigration Lawyers Association observed: “If you’re wealthy, if you can pay to play, then you’re welcome... but if you’re coming to seek humanitarian protection, then we’re going to make it much tougher.”</p><p>A Continent at a Crossroads</p><p>The 2026 travel expansion represents a fundamental shift in U.S.-Africa relations, moving away from developmental aid toward a transaction-based security model. Supporters argue these measures ensure American safety. Critics see a betrayal of humanitarian values that will only drive African partners toward Washington's rivals. Whether this \"Gold Card\" diplomacy can coexist with \"Shut Door\" security remains the defining question for the region's future.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The Concerned Drivers Association of Ghana (C-DAG) has sounded the alarm over the increasing number of road accidents nationwide, linking the trend largely to excessive daily sales targets imposed on commercial drivers.</p><p>In a statement endorsed by its National Chairman, William Osei, popularly known as Paa Willie, the Association noted that a significant number of recent crashes involve commercial vehicles.</p><p>According to C-DAG, unrealistic financial demands by some vehicle owners are forcing drivers to adopt unsafe practices, including over-speeding, working excessively long hours, and flouting traffic regulations in a bid to meet daily sales targets.</p><p>Speaking to Adom News, Mr. Osei appealed to vehicle owners to moderate their demands, warning that the current practice fuels reckless driving and leads to avoidable accidents.</p><p>“C-DAG has observed that the imposition of exorbitant daily sales targets by some car owners is a major factor contributing to these accidents,” he said.</p><p>He explained that, beyond meeting daily sales, factors such as envy and greed among some drivers—especially those attempting to repay vehicle loans quickly—often push them to take unnecessary risks on the road. Many drivers justify over-speeding and neglecting road safety regulations by citing the high sales targets set by owners.</p><p>The Association also expressed concern over the increasing use of Toyota Voxy vehicles for commercial transport. While the vehicle is known for comfort and smooth performance, C-DAG warned that its speed and easy acceleration could encourage reckless driving if not properly regulated.</p><p>With speeding identified as one of the leading causes of road crashes in Ghana, the Association urged drivers operating Toyota Voxy and similar vehicles to prioritise safety over financial gains.</p><p>Mr. Osei further revealed that driver unions and station managers at various transport terminals have implemented measures to discipline drivers who repeatedly ignore safety rules and traffic regulations.</p><p>“Easing this burden will relieve drivers of undue pressure and contribute significantly to saving lives on our roads,” he emphasised.</p><p>C-DAG is therefore calling on vehicle owners to review and moderate daily sales targets, stressing that reasonable demands will promote safer driving and help reduce road accidents. The Association also appealed to the government to invest in alternative transport systems, such as rail and water transport, to reduce pressure on road transport and curb the rising incidence of crashes.</p>"

The fire broke out on Sunday, January 4, 2026.</p><p>This comes amid growing concerns over harassment and attacks on media practitioners.</p><p>Speaking at the Government Accountability Series on Wednesday, January 14, Mr Kwakye Ofosu said the President is committed to working with key stakeholders to reorient personnel within the security services on how they should relate to journalists in the discharge of their duties.</p><p>According to the Minister, there remains a troubling perception among some members of the security agencies that journalists are a nuisance, particularly when they seek to investigate and uncover information of public interest.</p><p>“I think that the general attitude of some elements within the security services is that journalists are a bit of a nuisance, especially when they try to poke and find out what is happening, which is your job,” he said.</p><p>Mr Kwakye Ofosu noted that while journalism by its nature involves scrutiny and persistent questioning, some security personnel lack the tolerance to accommodate such work and instead resort to unlawful conduct.</p><p>“There are some of them who are unable to tolerate that and therefore vent their spleen on journalists in ways that are unlawful and seek to harm journalists,” he stated.</p><p>He stressed that government unequivocally condemns any form of intimidation, harassment or assault against journalists and will not condone such behaviour under any circumstances.</p><p>As part of measures to address the issue, the Minister disclosed that in the coming weeks government will engage the leadership of the various security agencies to organise a series of sensitisation and training activities.</p><p>“We would be engaging the heads of the security agencies to organise a series of activities to draw the attention of all members of Ghana’s security agencies to the fact that journalists are partners,” he said.</p><p>Mr Kwakye Ofosu emphasised that journalists have a legitimate right to investigate, ask questions and seek information in order to keep the public informed, adding that their work is essential to accountability in a democratic society.</p><p>“You have the right to nose around and fish out information to keep the public informed,” he said. “All manner of people who work within the public space are subject to scrutiny and accountability, and therefore the work you do goes a long way to enhance that.”</p><p>He further cautioned that even in situations where journalists are perceived to have breached protocol or security arrangements, the appropriate response should never involve the use of force.</p><p>“Under no circumstance should you come under attack or any form of harassment because you are doing your work,” he said.</p><p>“Even when it is deemed that you have violated protocol or some arrangements, the response to that should not be assault.”</p><p>Mr Kwakye Ofosu reaffirmed government’s commitment to safeguarding media freedom and ensuring that journalists can operate in a safe and enabling environment.</p>"

      "content": "Borussia Dortmund have announced the signing of German-born Ghanaian centre-back Leroy Kwadwo, who has joined the club on a short-term contract running until June 30, 2026.\nThe 29-year-old defender will feature for Borussia Dortmund’s U23 side, competing in the Regionalliga, for the remainder of the 2025/26 season.\nKwadwo was previously without a club after parting ways with TSV 1860 Munich and has been brought in to add experience and depth to Dortmund’s defensive unit.\nBorn in Herten, Kwadwo began his professional career at Rot-Weiss Essen, where he developed into a reliable central defender before going on to represent several clubs across Germany’s lower divisions.\nThe Ghanaian descent defender enjoyed a notable spell at TSV 1860 Munich and has built a solid reputation as a seasoned campaigner in the German football pyramid.\nAcross his career, Kwadwo has made 130 appearances in the 3. Liga and a further 40 matches in the Regionalliga, underlining his wealth of experience at that level.\nHe also featured four times in the 2. Bundesliga for WÃ¼rzburger Kickers, gaining exposure to higher-tier football.\nExplaining the decision to sign Kwadwo, Dortmund U23 Sporting Director Ingo Preuss said the defender was recruited at short notice to address a gap in central defence, highlighting his leadership and experience as key assets.\nKwadwo’s move represents a fresh opportunity to relaunch his career at one of Germany’s most respected clubs."

      "content": "<p>Legendary Ghanaian footballer, Charles Taylor has cautioned Asante Kotoko players to be wary of the manner in which they flirt with women after matches.\n\nAccording to him, it has become a norm at the club where some players are spotted engaging with women immediately after games.\n\nHowever, he believes the act does not augur well for the players, as it affects them psychologically, causing them to lose concentration, adding that this could impact their performances.\n\nDan Kwaku Yeboah fires GFA over ‘Kwaku Ananse’ Black Stars jersey\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Asempa FM, the former Kotoko player advised the team to desist from such unprofessional attitudes and focus on football.\n\n“Kotoko players like taking pictures with ladies after games too much. That’s why they easily lose concentration. They don’t care about the environment. You see them taking photos with women even after defeat, hands around them, hugging them and smiling. \n\n\"Any serious professional will avoid women after matches to prevent distractions and drama. But they simply don’t care. You will see them with ladies with big, big buttocks,” Charles Taylor added in Twi.\n\nThis development comes as tension grows in the Kotoko dressing room amid inconsistent performances, with the team trailing league leaders Medeama SC by six points.\n\nAfter failing to win their last two matches, the Porcupine Warriors currently sit fourth on the league table with 31 points.\n\nThis has increased pressure on head coach Karim Zito, whose future is on the line as board members deliberate on his future.\n\nSB/JE\n\n'To hell with them' – Professor Frimpong Boateng fires back at NPP\n\nTWI NEWS</p>"
