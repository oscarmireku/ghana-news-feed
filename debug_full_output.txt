  "content": "<p>Dear GhanaWeb,\n\n I’m a 29-year-old woman and I have a 5-year-old daughter. My daughter has been hospitalised.\n\n She was outside yesterday playing with a group of kids who live two houses away. There are no kids in our house, so anytime those kids came around, I make her go play with them since she’s always home alone and feels lonely.\n\n She’s only played with them a few times but it’s not that bad. I was washing yesterday, so I felt it was a good time for her to go and play while I finished what I was doing.\n\n After about an hour, the kids were all gone but my daughter didn’t return. So, I thought she followed them home.\n\n I went to the house to meet the kids and asked them but they said she didn’t come with them. According to one of the kids, she was still playing when they were leaving, so they left her where they had played.\n\n I panicked and quickly went around searching for her. I later found my daughter lying down behind the house, crying painfully and struggling to move, with blood stains all over her lower abdominal area.\n\n I rushed my daughter to the hospital only to find out she was raped. My baby’s innocence was taken by an evil person.\n\n She still can’t tell who did that to her. The police said they will find the person but I should wait for her to recover and be able to speak. They went to speak to the kids she played with today.\n\n What happened wasn’t done by a child. The doctor said it’s an adult. I don’t know who could have done that to my child. She was in severe pain.\n\n My baby daddy is so angry at me, he has threatened to take my daughter away from me if I don’t fix this. I’ve been so devastated and restless.\n\n I’ve just been thinking about this because what could be attractive on a 5-year-old? Some men can be so heartless.\n\n At this point, I don’t know what to do and how to go about this. I want justice for my child. I need help, please.\n\n FG/EB\n\n Watch Ofori Amponsah discuss interesting issues surrounding Lumba’s death, career path on this episode of Talkertainment:</p>"
