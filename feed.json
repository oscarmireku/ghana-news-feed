In fact, they welcome positive developments under Mahama’s leadership as long as they are in the best interests of the country. \n\nFor the NPP, the ultimate goal is to present a fresh vision for Ghana’s future, one that builds on existing successes while offering new possibilities for the nation.</p>"},{"id":"adom-0.19004713101324877","source":"AdomOnline","title":"2025 AFCON: Morocco face Nigeria, Senegal play Egypt in blockbuster semifinals","link":"https://www.adomonline.com/2025-afcon-morocco-face-nigeria-senegal-play-egypt-in-blockbuster-semifinals/","image":"https://www.adomonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-27-201645.png","time":"Jan 10, 5:37 PM","section":"Sports","content":"<p>The final four at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations have been decided, with the continent’s familiar powerhouses emerging from a gripping quarter-final round marked by intensity, late drama and decisive moments.</p><p>Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco and Senegal all booked their places in the semi-finals, bringing the last-eight stage to a close on Saturday night.</p><p>Hosts Morocco will lock horns with a star-studded Nigeria side, while Senegal — the first team to reach the semi-finals — are set for a heavyweight showdown against Egypt.

Ken Ofori-Atta is not a person that will come here, and we're going to treat him very shabbily and so on and so forth. He will be accorded due process of law. His fair trial rights will be guaranteed, and so on,” he disclosed.\n\nHe added that the conversation also included two other lawyers, and at the time, the discussions were strictly confidential.\n\n“So, I talked with John Ashcroft, including the lawyer who granted the interview [Enayat Qasimi], so there were three of them; three lawyers who spoke to me via Zoom on that day when they were expressing concerns. So, at that point in time, it was confidential. I could not mention John Ashcroft as his lawyer,” he stated.\n\nDr Ayine also explained why he had earlier described the lawyers as ‘top,’ a comment that drew some criticism from the public.\n\n“But I was simply saying that when you take the fact that he has these top lawyers coming to court in America to defend him, it is not going to be a day's work to bring him home,” he explained.\n\nThe AG further explained the legal process Ofori-Atta may face in the US, including appearing before an immigration judge on January 20, 2026, with the right to appeal through the district court, circuit court of appeals, and potentially the US Supreme Court. \n\nHe also noted that any extradition proceedings would follow a similar multi-level judicial pathway.\n\n“In this current matter, he will appear before an immigration judge on January 20th [2026]. He has a right to appeal that decision to a district court. From the district court, it can go to a circuit court of appeals. Then from there to the United States Supreme Court.

In fact, in his case, I'm doing it with some foreign investigators who are tracking all the offshore dealings and so on. We are also doing our own investigations here. They are inconclusive, as we speak. I mean, we have not come to any conclusion,” Dr Ayine revealed.\n\n Describing the investigations as serious and potentially far-reaching, the Attorney General emphasised that collaboration with US authorities began long before the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) issued any public statements.\n\n “So, I started working with the Americans in respect of Ofori-Atta long before OSP came up with the announcement. I started working with them, and I want Ghanaians to know that he just didn't overstay his visa,” he clarified.\n\n According to Dr Ayine, the US State Department revoked Ofori-Atta’s visa in July (sic) and gave him until November 29 to leave the country. His failure to comply prompted enforcement action.\n\n “The visa was actually revoked. So, it's not that Ofori-Atta overstayed. So, in July, the American State Department revoked his visa, and they gave him up to November 29 (sic) to leave the United States. He did not. And then, that is how come that they decided they were going to now pursue him, and arrest him.\n\n \"Actually, the arrest was supposed to occur on January 4th [2026], and they did not do so, but on Tuesday, January 6, 2026, they apprehended him in the Virginia area and took him into custody,” he explained.\n\n He stressed that the matter is far more than an immigration issue.\n\n “It's not exactly about immigration. It was revoked. The visa was revoked. I am telling you this on authority,” he stated.\n\n The AG’s confirmation corroborates statements by the Acting Director General of the National Road Safety Authority (NRSA), Abraham Amaliba, who said that the detention of Ofori-Atta in the United States is directly linked to efforts by the Attorney General's office to secure his extradition.\n\n Amaliba clarified that the revocation of Ofori-Atta’s US visa and his subsequent arrest were not due to an expired visa or immigration overstay, but resulted from actions initiated by Ghanaian authorities through the Attorney General.\n\n Ken Ofori-Atta arrested and detained in the US\n\n “Now, I can confirm to you that this [Ofori-Atta’s detention] is part of the processes leading up to his extradition, and this is the handiwork of our Attorney General. And I can tell you that it is the Attorney General who, in his attempts to get Ofori-Atta back here, made the US authorities revoke his stay status.\n\n “His visa has not expired. Manasseh told us that it will be in February, so anybody who writes a letter saying that it is part of the overstay extension is a hoax,” Amaliba stated while speaking on TV3’s Newday on January 9, 2026.\n\n MAG/AE</p>"},{"id":"gw-11.603128503441608","source":"GhanaWeb","title":"'Let's get to work' – Erling Haaland welcomes Antoine Semenyo","link":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/Let-s-get-to-work-Erling-Haaland-welcomes-Antoine-Semenyo-2016651","image":"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/802/80240126.jpg","time":"Jan 10, 6:42 AM","section":"Sports","content":"<p>Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has given a warm welcome to the club’s new signing, Antoine Semenyo, after the 26-year-old joined from Bournemouth for a reported £65 million.\n\nHaaland shared a selfie of himself with Semenyo on social media, captioning it simply: “Welcome”, signaling both camaraderie and excitement at the arrival of the versatile attacker. \n\nManchester City’s official accounts also posted the image with the message: “Let’s get to work”, underlining the team’s readiness to integrate the Ghana international into Pep Guardiola’s plans.\n\nSemenyo, who will wear the number 42 shirt, arrived at City following a prolific start to the 2025/26 season at Bournemouth, scoring 10 Premier League goals and providing three assists. \n\nEx-Chelsea player Lamisha Musonda reveals he has just a few days left to live\n\nHis versatility on both wings and proven goal-scoring record make him a key addition to City’s attacking options as they pursue Premier League and Champions League glory.\n\nThe early glimpses of Semenyo at the club, from training sessions to the friendly introduction with Haaland, suggest he is already settling into the squad. \n\nGuardiola and his teammates will now look to harness his pace, power, and finishing ability as City aim to strengthen their already formidable attack in the second half of the season.\n\n\n\nFKA/MA</p>"},{"id":"gw-17.67680894889092","source":"GhanaWeb","title":"Despite all the challenges, I haven't given up on Ghana – Professor Stephen Adei","link":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/Despite-all-the-challenges-I-haven-t-given-up-on-Ghana-Professor-Stephen-Adei-2016650","image":"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/859/85945864.jpg","time":"Jan 10, 6:32 AM","section":"Business","content":"<p>Educationist and former Chairman of the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), Professor Stephen Adei, has urged Ghanaians to remain optimistic about Ghana’s future, despite what he described as persistent disappointments in the country’s governance and leadership.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with GhanaWeb on the sidelines of the CEO’s Summit and Hangout held on January 9, 2026, at Big Joe’s Garden, Tema Community 7, Professor Adei said he remains hopeful that Ghana will eventually overcome its current challenges and realise its full potential.\n\n“We are living in exciting times in Ghana.

But there is another leg of the loss that will come up in the BoG’s audited accounts, and it will be higher.”\n\n Dr Boako explained that the additional losses are connected to how the Bank of Ghana operates its cedi-dollar-gold transactions.\n\n He criticised the current regime, under which cedis are collected from banks to purchase gold at Bloomberg rates, only to sell the resulting dollars back at the Bank of Ghana’s artificially appreciated rate.\n\n Dr Boako attributes this new loss to the additional six tonnes of gold in the Bank of Ghana vault. According to him, because the central bank is currently operating a multiple exchange rate system, a practice criticised by the IMF-Bank of Ghana buys the reserve gold at a higher Bloomberg rate and keeps it in their vault at an artificial rate 10% lower than the Bloomberg rate. This is why Dr Boako strongly believes the auditors of BoG will value the reserve gold at a rate lower than how much it was purchased for, leading to exchange losses.\n\n “The IMF report has said this is not good and will continue to cause more losses,” he added.\n\n He concluded that these emerging figures reflect the policy environment rather than the operational design of GoldBod.\n\n According

government will soon establish a 24-Hour Authority as part of its efforts to implement its flagship 24-hour economy policy fully.\n\nThe Authority will be responsible for registering businesses that opt into the initiative and outlining the incentives available to support their operations.\n\nAccording to a report by myjoyonline.com, the President disclosed this during a visit to the Ghana Publishing Company on Thursday, January 8, 2026, where he praised management for adopting innovative measures, including a two-shift work system, ahead of the policy’s rollout.\n\n24-hour economy policy inspires remarkable GPCL turnaround\n\nPresident Mahama said the committee mandated to review the 24-hour economy framework has completed its work and is expected to submit its report to Parliament to enable the creation of the Authority.\n\n“I’m happy to note that the committee has finished considering it, and it’s supposed to go onto the floor of Parliament to set up the 24-Hour Authority, which would then open the way for implementation and registration of all the businesses that will be involved in the 24-hour economy initiative,” he said.\n\nHe explained that the Authority will also clearly define the incentives for participating businesses, noting that early adopters, such as the Ghana Publishing Company, are likely to benefit significantly.\n\nPresident Mahama urged management of companies to formally register under the 24-hour economy initiative once the Authority is established, expressing confidence that the policy will enhance productivity, strengthen state-owned enterprises, and drive broader economic transformation.\n\nID/BAI\n\nYou can also watch more videos from Naser Toure's funeral

9, 2:46 PM","section":"Business","content":"<p>The Member of Parliament for Obuasi West, Kwaku Kwarteng, has urged President John Dramani Mahama to take bold and difficult economic decisions without fear of electoral consequences.\n\nAccording to citinewsroom.com, the former Deputy Minister of Finance, during an interview on January 8, 2026, dismissed the notion that enforcing fiscal discipline and holding taxpayers accountable would cost the government political support.\n\nAccording to him, President Mahama is uniquely positioned to implement such long-overdue reforms but has so far shown little indication of pursuing clear policy changes.\n\nGhana is rising again – Mahama declares\n\nHe argued that critical areas such as interest payments and wage bills remain largely unaddressed, stating that the government has been lax when it comes to such.\n\n“The suggestion that once you are tough, once you go after people who pay their taxes, once you rein in expenditure, somehow, you are going to lose an election, I do not believe that. And I think President Mahama is in the unique position to do the reforms I am calling for.\n\n“So far, I have not seen much. I have yet to see any clear change. If you look at the big items in our expenditure profile, the wage bill and interest payments, what are the policy positions or the changes the government is pursuing on these lines? If we cannot discuss clear changes, then it is very much business as usual,\" he said.\n\nKwarteng urged the president to make such decisions, no matter how tough, since he would not be vying for a reelection once his tenure is over.\n\n“I take this opportunity to speak to the president and to say, ‘You are not coming back; please deploy the hard decisions that this country has been needing for so long',” he said.\n\nID/AE</p>"},{"id":"adom-1.2242829513329523","source":"AdomOnline","title":"2025 AFCON: Senegal beat 10-man Mali to book last four spot","link":"https://www.adomonline.com/2025-afcon-senegal-beat-10-man-mali-to-book-last-four-spot/","image":"https://www.adomonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iliman-ndiaye-of-senegal-celebrates-goal-during-2025-africa-cup-of-nations-quarter-final-match-between-mali-and-senegal.webp","time":"Jan 9, 2:37 PM","section":"Sports","content":null},{"id":"gw-10.424980430549402","source":"GhanaWeb","title":"Support the NDC government to deliver results – Capt Amoabeng to business community","link":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/Support-the-NDC-government-to-deliver-results-Capt-Amoabeng-to-business-community-2016607","image":"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/235/23540307.200.jpg","time":"Jan 9, 2:29 PM","section":"Business","content":null},{"id":"3news-6.131429520732631","source":"3News","title":"UG fees hike: Stakeholders meet to discuss way forward","link":"https://3news.com/news/ug-fees-hike-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-way-forward","image":"https://editors.3news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-09-at-13.52.52-e1767968444344.jpeg","time":"Jan 9, 2:22 PM","section":"News","content":null},{"id":"gw-13.262017478139619","source":"GhanaWeb","title":"Semenyo becomes the most expensive transfer in Ghana’s football history","link":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/Semenyo-becomes-the-most-expensive-transfer-in-Ghana-s-football-history-2016605","image":"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/159/15960802.jpg","time":"Jan 9, 1:37 PM","section":"Sports","content":"<p>Ghanaian winger Antoine Semenyo has made history after joining Premier League giants Manchester City in a deal worth £64 million.\n\nThe Bournemouth forward has emerged as the only Ghanaian player to be involved in a transfer worth €74 million, topping the list of all-time most expensive transfers in Ghana’s football history.\n\nBREAKING: Manchester City complete the signing of Antoine Semenyo\n\nOthers who rank below him include:\n\nKudus Mohammed, from West Ham United to Tottenham Hotspur – €64 million (second);\n\nThomas Partey, from Atlético Madrid to Arsenal – €50 million (third);\n\nMohammed Kudus, from Ajax to West Ham United – €43 million (fourth);\n\nMichael Essien, from Lyon to Chelsea – €38 million (fifth);\n\nErnest Nuamah, from RWDM Brussels to Olympique Lyon – €28.5 million (sixth);\n\nKamaldeen Sulemana, from Stade Rennais to Southampton – €25 million (seventh);\n\nErnest Nuamah – €25 million (eighth);\n\nBaba Rahman, from Augsburg to Chelsea – €24.4 million (ninth);\n\nAndré Ayew, from Swansea City to West Ham United – £24.1 million (tenth).\n\nThe expensive nature of the transfer places a huge responsibility on Semenyo’s shoulders to impress at the club and continue his goals-scoring form to avoid criticisms from the media.\n\nThe Ghanaian forward signed a five-and-a-half-year contract with Pep Guardiola’s side. Semenyo will wear the number 42 shirt at the Etihad and expressed optimism during the contract signing.\n\nAlthough Semenyo had a £65 million release clause, City struck an agreement with Bournemouth worth £62.5 million, with a further £1.5 million in performance-related bonuses and a 10 percent sell-on clause included.\n\nWhile the guaranteed part of the release clause was £60 million, Bournemouth will actually receive slightly more, with the £62.5 million paid in 24 monthly instalments.\n\nSB/AE\n\nWatch as Accra Mayor shares memories of late Toure Mahama</p>"},{"id":"adom-10.370589700277986","source":"AdomOnline","title":"Mobile Money vendor allegedly commits suicide in Hohoe","link":"https://www.adomonline.com/mobile-money-vendor-allegedly-commits-suicide-in-hohoe/","image":"https://www.adomonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG-20190629-WA0005.jpg","time":"Jan 9, 1:34 PM","section":"News","content":null},{"id":"gw-5.906164468837277","source":"GhanaWeb","title":"Government committed to completing Gomoa Pomadze Poultry Project – Prof Opoku-Agyemang","link":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/Government-committed-to-completing-Gomoa-Pomadze-Poultry-Project-Prof-Opoku-Agyemang-2016604","image":"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/229/22967244.jpg","time":"Jan 9, 1:28 PM","section":"Business","content":null},{"id":"gw-12.004110125762722","source":"GhanaWeb","title":"Government committed to completing Gomoa Pomadze Poultry Project – Veep","link":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/Government-committed-to-completing-Gomoa-Pomadze-Poultry-Project-Veep-2016604","image":"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/229/22967244.jpg","time":"Jan 9, 1:28 PM","section":"Business","content":"<p>Vice President Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang has reaffirmed the John Dramani Mahama administration’s commitment to completing the Gomoa Pomadze Poultry Project in the Central Region, describing it as a key intervention in strengthening Ghana’s food security.\n\nSpeaking at the 93rd Jalsa Salana of the National Convention of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission on Thursday, January 8, 2026, at Gomoa Pomadze, the vice president said the project would be developed with modern, purpose-built infrastructure capable of housing about 100,000 birds.\n\nAccording to her, the facility will include modern feeding systems, a feed mill, and environmentally-responsible waste management systems to ensure sustainable operations.\n\n“The Pomadze Poultry Initiative is progressing. The project aligns with national efforts under Feed Ghana and Nkoko Nkitinkiti to boost domestic poultry production, generate jobs, stabilize prices, and improve food security,” Prof Opoku-Agyemang stated in a Facebook post.\n\nGovernment distributes 720,000 birds under Nkoko Nkitinkiti programme\n\nShe noted that the project aligns with the government’s broader agricultural agenda, particularly the Feed Ghana and “Nkokonkitinkiti” programmes, which are aimed at boosting domestic poultry production and reducing the country’s heavy dependence on imported poultry products.\n\n“This initiative aligns directly with our national objectives under the Feed Ghana and ‘Nkokonkitinkiti’ to strengthen domestic poultry production and, significantly, reduce reliance on imports by 2028,” she added.\n\n\n\nThe Gomoa Pomadze Poultry Project is expected to create jobs, support local farmers, and contribute to stabilising poultry prices while enhancing Ghana’s self-sufficiency in poultry production.\n\nAside from agriculture, Vice President Prof Opoku-Agyemang cited government investments in other sectors in the town, noting them as examples of 'humanity in action.'\n\n\"Beyond agriculture, I acknowledged the community’s significant investments in education, healthcare, and humanitarian service, including the important role played by the Lajna Imaillah, the women's wing.

9, 10:29 AM","section":"Business","content":"<p>A US-based Monetary Economist, Dr. Dennis Nsafoah, has attributed the cedi appreciation in 2025 solely to the Bank of Ghana's monetary policy.</p><p>According to him, the sharp appreciation of the cedi, from about GH¢15.80 per dollar in early 2025 to around GH¢10.80 by May 2025, coincided precisely with a collapse in the growth rate of reserves held at the Bank of Ghana. In other words, as cedi liquidity was withdrawn from the system, pressure on the foreign exchange market eased and the currency strengthened.</p><p>He stated that the contraction of the cedi liquidity reduced private demand for foreign exchange, reinforcing disinflation and driving the observed shift cedi depreciation to appreciation.</p><p>“In the long run, exchange rates are governed by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and the Quantity Theory of Money, where relative money supplies and inflation differentials determine currency values. Given Ghana’s history of volatile inflation, the long-run framework is particularly instructive”, Dr. Nsafoah who is an Assistant Professor of Economics at Niagara University, New York, pointed out.</p><p>He further stated that if inflation in Ghana falls relative to inflation in the United States according to PPP, the cedi should appreciate. Under the Quantity Theory of Money, this disinflation is achieved by reducing the growth of money in circulation. “This is exactly what occurred in 2025”.</p><p>The Experience of 2025 Delivers a Powerful Message</p><p>Continuing, Dr. Nsafoah, who is a Member of the Research Committee, Tesah Capital, said many factors influence inflation and exchange rates, but monetary policy remains the decisive force. “The Bank of Ghana’s actions — tightening liquidity, anchoring expectations, and allowing monetary conditions to bite — were central to Ghana’s macroeconomic stabilisation”.</p><p>Finally, he stressed that if one is looking for an early warning signal of whether — and when — the exchange rate may return to episodes of sharp and disorderly depreciation, the key variable to monitor is not external shocks or speculative narratives, but a policy variable fully under the control of the Bank of Ghana.</p><p>He concluded that the experience of 2025 shows that exchange rate stability coincided with the contraction or modest growth of bank reserves at the central bank.</p><p>Therefore, as long as reserves held with the Bank of Ghana are shrinking or growing only moderately, pressure on the foreign exchange market remains contained.</p><p>“However, if the growth rate of these reserves were to reverse course —returning to the 50 percent to triple-digit annual growth rates observed in earlier years — this would signal a renewed surge in cedi liquidity. History suggests that such an expansion would quickly translate into excess demand for foreign currency and a renewed phase of sharp cedi depreciation”, he added.</p>"},{"id":"gw-17.060316643061796","source":"GhanaWeb","title":"From ORAL to ICE: The breakdown of all Ken Ofori-Atta's woes","link":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/From-ORAL-to-ICE-The-breakdown-of-all-Ken-Ofori-Atta-s-woes-2016585","image":"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/964/96409390.200.jpg","time":"Jan 9, 10:19 AM","section":"News","content":null},{"id":"gw-12.358207575539547","source":"GhanaWeb","title":"FIFA secretary Grafstrom applauds AFCON 2025 standards","link":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/FIFA-secretary-Grafstrom-applauds-AFCON-2025-standards-2016584","image":"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/614/61483686.jpg","time":"Jan 9, 10:07 AM","section":"Sports","content":"<p>FIFA General Secretary Mattias Grafström has praised the organisation, quality and overall standards of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), describing the tournament as a strong reflection of Africa’s growing football excellence and organisational capacity.\n\n“It’s been a privilege to watch a few games, and it’s been a great experience both organizationally and sportingly,” Grafström said during a roundtable engagement with selected African journalists at the FIFA African Hub in Rabat.\n\nHe singled out Morocco’s role as host, highlighting the country’s experience and preparedness in staging major international football events.\n\nGhana drawn in Group L for 2026 FIFA World Cup\n\n“The tournament has really shown the experience of Morocco as a host for the Africa Cup of Nations, which is also good as they are hosting the FIFA Africa Hub Office,” he added.\n\nGrafström reaffirmed FIFA’s long-term commitment to African football development, stressing the importance of collaboration with CAF, Member Associations and the media in driving sustainable growth.\n\nHe also underlined the crucial role of the media in shaping football development across the continent, calling for openness and transparency in communication.\n\n“FIFA is here to invest, develop and work hand-in-hand with CAF, Member Associations and Media to make African football great.

Such is the magnitude of achievement of Anne Jiagge who clearly deserves much more recognition than she is given.\n\nA publication by UK-based law portal gatehouselaw.co.uk in celebration of her marvellous works details that Anne Jiagge was born as Anne Ruth Baeta in French Togoland on October 7, 1918.\n\nAccording to braperucci.africa, Anne Jiagge's father was a Presbyterian priest by name of Robert Baeta who had eight children with his wife.\n\nShe attended Achimota College where she obtained a teaching certificate in 1937. From 1940 to 1946, she was headmistress and schoolteacher at the Evangelical Presbyterian Girls School.\n\nHer successful foray into the legal profession commenced in 1946 when she enrolled at the London School of Economics and Political Science to study law.\n\nShe graduated from the school with flying colours and received her LLB in 1949, she was subsequently called to the UK Bar.\n\nShe returned to Ghana (then Gold Coast) in 1950 and set up her private firm which she operated for three years.\n\nShe dropped the bar for the bench in 1953 and began as a magistrate. From there, she worked her way up and became Ghana's first female High Court judge in September 1961.\n\nAnnie was the first female judge of the Court of Appeal. She later became president of the Court of Appeal in 1980 until her retirement in 1983.\n\nShe played a great role in the drafting of Ghana's 3rd and 4th Republican constitutions, serving on the committee of experts who put together the documents.\n\nUntil her demise in 1996, she was a member of the Council of State.\n\nThis article was first published by GhanaWeb on Saturday, December 28,

retirees with lower benefits.\n\nThe indexation will be applied in two parts: a flat 6% increase for all pensioners, with the remaining 4% pool redistributed to bolster the incomes of those at the lower end of the pension scale. \n\nThis mechanism ensures that the effective raise for lower-income pensioners will exceed the headline 10% rate, the report added.\n\n'I will raise our economy to a

key economic indicators, including salary growth of active contributors, the government’s projected inflation band of 8% ± 2 by end-2025, and the imperative to maintain the pension fund’s long-term sustainability.\n\n“SSNIT has also increased the minimum monthly pension for new pensioners from GH¢300.00 to GH¢400.00, strengthening the pension floor across the scheme,” Adjei stated.\n\nThe

9, 8:02 AM","section":"Business","content":"<p>About 2,000 rubber farmers and aggregators from the Western region have staged a peaceful demonstration in the Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis to protest calls for a total ban on raw rubber exports, describing claims against the trade as misleading and self-serving.</p><p>The demonstrators, drawn from rubber-growing communities across the Western Region, marched through some principal streets of Sekondi-Takoradi before presenting a petition to the Western Regional Minister, Joseph Nelson, at the Regional Coordinating Council.</p><p>Most of the protesters were clad in red and black, carrying placards with inscriptions such as “Farmers Say No to Monopoly,” “Rubber Is for All Ghanaians,” “No Instant Payment, No Ban,” “Processors Are Greedy,” and “Everyone Must Eat\".</p><p>Exports are Regulated, not Unchecked Farmers</p><p>In the petition issued by the Rubber Farmers of Ghana (RUFAG) and allied actors in the natural rubber industry, the group rejected claims that raw rubber exports are unchecked and undermining Ghana’s industrialisation drive.</p><p>According to the farmers, exports of raw rubber operate under an existing government-approved regulatory framework supervised by the Tree Crops Development Authority (TCDA).</p><p>They cited a TCDA directive issued on May 2, 2025, which requires all exporters of unprocessed rubber, cashew and shea to be registered, licensed and issued permits before export.</p><p>“This directive is strictly enforced in collaboration with the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority, the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority and other security agencies,” the petition stated, adding that TCDA maintains a permanent presence at the ports to ensure compliance.</p><p>The farmers argue that claims of “unchecked exports” ignore the regulatory framework established under Act 1010 and L.I. 2471.</p><p>Processors Accused of Pushing Monopoly Agenda</p><p>RUFAG accused some processing companies and their allies of pushing for an export ban not to promote industrialisation, but to eliminate competition and force farmers to sell rubber cup lumps at low prices.</p><p>They warned that restricting competition would hurt, rather than protect, jobs in the sector. While processing factories reportedly employ fewer than 1,000 workers nationwide, the farmers noted that rubber farming and trading sustain the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, including tappers, carriers, loaders, farm maintenance workers and transport operators.</p><p>“In total, over two million dependents rely on incomes generated from rubber farming activities,” the petition stated, warning that lower farm-gate prices could deepen rural poverty and push more youth into illegal mining.</p><p>Disputing Revenue Loss Claims</p><p>The farmers also questioned claims that Ghana loses up to US$100 million annually due to raw rubber exports.</p><p>They insist exporters comply with statutory levies payable to TCDA, while alleging that some processing companies themselves are not fully complying with levy payments, contrary to claims of supporting government revenue mobilisation.</p><p>Limited Value Addition in Ghana</p><p>RUFAG further argued that Ghana currently lacks advanced rubber processing factories, noting that most local processors only convert rubber cup lumps into Technically Specified Rubber (TSR), which remains a primary commodity for export.</p><p>After decades of operation, the farmers say Ghana is yet to see significant production of finished rubber products such as tyres, gloves or medical supplies, questioning the industrialisation argument being advanced.</p><p>COVID-19 LessonsThe farmers recalled that during the COVID-19 pandemic, several processors suspended purchases, leaving farmers stranded, while exporters provided alternative markets that helped sustain livelihoods.“This experience shows that multiple markets offer security to farmers and prevent unnecessary hardship,” the petition noted.</p><p>No Illegality in Exports Farmers Insist</p><p>The group dismissed assertions that raw rubber exports violate Act 1010 or L.I. 2471, insisting that the laws do not prohibit exports but rather empower TCDA to regulate them through a permit system.</p><p>They warned that allegations of illegality without credible evidence could undermine investor confidence and weaken trust in regulatory institutions.</p><p>Disassociation from ANRAGIn the petition, the farmers formally dissociated themselves from the Association of Natural Rubber Actors of Ghana (ANRAG), describing it as a processor-driven group that does not represent the interests of the wider rubber value chain.</p><p>They urged government and policymakers to engage broadly with all legitimate stakeholders before taking decisions that affect the industry.</p><p>Regional Minister Responds</p><p>Receiving the petition, Western Regional Minister Joseph Nelson commended the demonstrators for their peaceful conduct and assured them their concerns would be forwarded to the appropriate authorities, including the President of the Republic of Ghana.</p>"},{"id":"joy-4.786632134821796","source":"MyJoyOnline","title":"Antoine Semenyo joins Manchester City until

But is it novel? Is it the case that it has never been done in any first year of a government? And the answer is no,” he said.</p><p>Dr Kabiru cautioned against what he described as an exaggerated narrative about current economic performance, insisting that similar, and in some cases stronger, indicators had been recorded in the past under IMF-supported programmes.</p><p>He pointed to the period between 2017 and 2019, noting that Ghana experienced growth, primary budget surpluses, and positive macroeconomic indicators, all under IMF arrangements.</p><p>“In 2017, we had similar euphoria around the first budget. We had growth that was far in excess of what we are experiencing now. We had a primary budget surplus and all the positive indicators. But we have to also know that in all these years, we had IMF-supported programmes,” he said.</p><p>He warned against creating the impression that Ghana’s current stability is unprecedented.</p><p>“Whilst we give credit, let us not create a sense that this is the first time, in a government’s first year in office, that we are having this kind of result,” he added.</p><p>Dr Kabiru compared public sentiment then and now, citing approval ratings to reinforce his argument.</p><p>“The euphoria around the 2017 budget, and the outcome of that budget, with the greatest respect, was far more than what we are experiencing. Approval rating for the president at the end of his first year, according to Afrobarometer, was 70 per cent. Here we are having 67 per cent,” he said.</p><p>Despite his criticism, he said he was not dismissing the gains entirely.</p><p>“That notwithstanding, I do not want to diminish the impact, the growth, the macroeconomic and price stability that we are experiencing,” he said.</p><p>However, he insisted that any honest assessment must place the IMF programme at the centre of the recovery.</p><p>“If anyone wants to say that anything has contributed to this without first acknowledging the IMF-supported programme we have, which has served as an anchor, which is the big man in the house driving whatever we do, then I disagree,” he said.</p><p>He argued that without the programme, Ghana could easily slide back into fiscal indiscipline.</p><p>“But for the programme, we may have to see some government fiscal indiscipline,” he added.</p><p>Dr Kabiru said the President and the Finance Minister deserve credit for sticking to the programme, but not for portraying the recovery as entirely home-grown.</p><p>“The fact that the President and the Finance Minister have committed to the programme is worthy of commendation. But for me, we should not create a sense that it is the first time it’s happening,” he said.</p><p>He also stressed that the recovery should be viewed cautiously.</p><p>“We should only hope and pray that it is sustainable. We shouldn’t be looking at the recovery as something that we should celebrate over,” he said.</p><p>Dr Kabiru said some credit must also go to the previous government, which initiated the IMF programme now anchoring the economy.</p><p>“There is a programme that the previous government initiated that the previous government must actually also take some of the credit for,” he said.</p><p>Ultimately, he argued that the true test of the economy lies ahead.</p><p>“Let’s see how we move into the second and third year. If the government should put in the third year, then we would know the true state of the economy, and whether or not the commendation we are giving now should be temporary or permanent,” he added.</p>"},{"id":"dailyguide-1.3821217253585054","source":"DailyGuide","title":"I Knew Ebo Noah Was Creating Content – Sarkodie","link":"https://dailyguidenetwork.com/i-knew-ebo-noah-was-creating-content-sarkodie/","image":"https://dailyguidenetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sarkodie.jpg","time":"Jan 8, 6:52 AM","section":"News","content":"<p>Rapper Sarkodie has broken his silence on the arrest of controversial self-styled prophet, Ebo Noah, insisting the viral figure was merely creating content and not committing a crime.</p><p>In an Instagram story posted on January 2, 2026, Sarkodie reacted to a circulating video showing Evans Eshun, popularly known as Ebo Noah, in handcuffs as he was escorted into a police vehicle.

Lower food inflation directly eases pressure on household budgets,” Dr. Iddrisu noted.</p><p>However, he cautioned that food prices still rose by 1.1 percent month on month, suggesting that while long-term pressures have eased, short-term fluctuations remain, largely driven by seasonal factors.</p><p>Non-food inflation also declined significantly, easing to 5.8 percent in December, from 6.1 percent in November and 20.3 percent a year earlier, reflecting a 14.5 percentage point reduction over the year. On a monthly basis, non-food prices increased by 0.6 percent, indicating moderate pressure.</p><p>“These trends show broad-based disinflation across both food and non-food categories, rather than improvements driven by a single component,” Dr. Iddrisu said.</p><p>The data also revealed a strong slowdown in goods inflation, which fell to 5.8 percent in December 2025, down from 7.3 percent in November and 23.1 percent in December 2024.

While acknowledging recent gains in macroeconomic stability, including signs of cedi stabilization, Otumfuo cautioned against complacency and urged policymakers to focus more deliberately on reducing borrowing costs.</p><p>“I hope the unavoidable attention being paid to the cedi does not mean we are relegating the second mandate of the Bank—which has to do with interest rates—to the back burner,” he said.</p><p>Although interest rates have started to edge downward, the Asantehene stressed that past experience shows the pace of reduction must be faster if businesses are to grow and remain competitive.</p><p>“Domestic private investment cannot happen at the current cutthroat interest rate regime,” he stated, challenging the Bank’s leadership to adopt innovative approaches that move the economy from high-interest constraints toward an environment that supports business expansion and wealth creation.</p><p>Highlighting the importance of domestic investment amid global uncertainty, Otumfuo warned that Ghana cannot rely heavily on foreign investment to drive growth amid rising geopolitical tensions.</p><p>“No amount of government investment can scratch the surface of what we need to build a sound economy,” he said. “This moment calls for a massive push to stimulate domestic private investment in industry.”</p><p>He emphasized that affordable credit remains the most critical factor for unlocking the productive potential of Ghanaian businesses and entrepreneurs.</p><p>The Asantehene also acknowledged that the country has begun to “breathe easy” as the cedi shows signs of stability on the foreign exchange market. However, he cautioned against premature celebration.</p><p>“These are only the earliest tools of progress,” he said, echoing earlier remarks by the Governor of the Bank of Ghana that stability must be sustained before declaring success. “We must be careful not to start feasting before the true state of the harvest is known.”</p>"},{"id":"gw-12.955861136870382","source":"GhanaWeb","title":"BoG targets UK diaspora to revive falling remittances","link":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/BoG-targets-UK-diaspora-to-revive-falling-remittances-2016466","image":"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/487/48719783.200.jpg","time":"Jan 8, 4:09 AM","section":"Business","content":null},{"id":"gw-4.5165890852649015","source":"GhanaWeb","title":"2026 World Cup: Ablakwa promises British High Commissioner a feast if Black Stars beat England","link":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/2026-World-Cup-Ablakwa-promises-British-High-Commissioner-a-feast-if-Black-Stars-beat-England-2016448","image":"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/433/43343371.200.jpg","time":"Jan 7, 8:58 PM","section":"Sports","content":null}],"debug_logs":["DailyGuide: Found 10 items"]}
